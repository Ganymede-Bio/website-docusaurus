This guide walks you through creating a dashboard to visualize plate reader data ingested into Ganymede. This dashboard will leverage the same data ingested and processed in the [Build a Flow guide](./QuickstartBuildFlow). By the time you're finished, you'll have converted raw data to a dashboard that looks like this:

<div class="text--center">
<img width="800" alt="Absorbance Analytics Dashboard" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/apiServer/AbsorbanceAnalyticsDashboard_20230531.png"/>
</div>

To do this we'll proceed through the following steps:
- Sign into Ganymede
- Set up virtual datasets
- Build charts from those virtual datasets
- Add those charts to a dashboard

### Step 1: Sign into Ganymede

The <div className="button gray_button"><UserOutlined /> Sign In</div> button should be available once authentication is configured for your tenant, which is generally going to be a web address accessible via any web browser with the URL [https://<your_tenant\>.ganymede.bio](https://<your_tenant>.ganymede.bio).

<div class="text--center">
  <img width="400" alt="Ganymede sign-in" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/apiServer/GanymedeSignIn_20230110.png"/>
</div>

### Step 2. Create the necessary virtual datasets for this visualization

In order to create our dashboard we'll need to load two datasets into the dashboard environment, a **Quickstart_Absorbance_Change_Absolute_Differences** dataset and a **Quickstart_Absorbance_Change_Run_Parameters** dataset. To load a dataset, navigate to dashboards, hover over **Data**, and click **Dataset**.

Hover over SQL Lab in the top menu bar and click on SQL Editor.  This should bring you to a SQL editor that lets you preview tables, and results of SQL queries:

<img alt="Dashboard - SQL Editor" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/SQL_Lab20230531.png" />
&nbsp;

Fill in the SQL Editor with the query below, select an appropriate number of rows to observe, and click <div className="button darkblue_button">**RUN**</div> to execute SQL.

```sql
SELECT field, run_diff, left(field, 1) as row, cast(right(field, length(field)-1) as int64) as column
FROM Quickstart_Absorbance_Change_Transform_py_analysis 
UNPIVOT (value for run IN (run1, run2))
WHERE field not in ('Time [s]', 'Temp. [Â°C]', 'Cycle Nr.')
```
<img alt="Dashboard - SQL Editor Query" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/SQL_Query_Quickstart_Absorbance_Change_Absolute_Differences.png" />

Save a virtual dataset by clicking on the **Create Chart** button, which should bring up the following modal:

<img alt="Dashboard - Add Virtual Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Add_Virtual_Dataset20230415.png" />

Make sure **Save as new** is checked and give your dataset the name "Quickstart_Absorbance_Change_Absolute_Differences".

Navigate back to the SQL Editor and repeat this process with the below query, saving it as "Quickstart_Absorbance_Change_Run_Parameters". Now you've created the datasets you'll need to build your dashboard.


## Step 3. Creating charts to visualize data

Charts can be created from physical or virtual datasets.  

To create a chart:

- Hover over Data in the top menu bar and click on Datasets.  Then, click on one of the listed datasets, which should bring up the following pane:

<img alt="Dashboard - Create Chart" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Create_Chart20230415.png" />

The DATA tab has controls for specifying chart type and pivoting/aggregating data from the selected table.  The customize tab has functionality for annotating axis labels, specifying axis format, and chart title.

### Saving charts to dashboards

- Once the created chart looks satisfactory, add a chart to a dashboard by clicking on **SAVE** in the upper-right hand corner of the screen to bring up this modal:

<img alt="Dashboard - Save Chart" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Save_Chart20230415.png" />

### Calculated columns

Calculated columns can be added to the dataset, which can be handy for correcting data for visualization.  Some example use cases are:

- Taking the floor or ceiling of a variable to truncate data outside of a desired range
- Performing string manipulations on a field to categorize or subset data
- Extracting values from a string for aggregation

To create a calculated column:

- Hover over the three dots to the right of the dataset on the Chart Creation page and click Edit Dataset.

<img alt="Dashboard - Edit Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Edit_Dataset20230415.png" />

- Select the Calculated Columns tab to add new columns to the dataset.  Specify the field definition using a SQL expression.

:::tip Calculated Column flexibility

Calculated columns are more flexible than what is found in other BI tools offering similar functionality.  Beyond aggregation, these fields 
can be filtered on, sorted by, and/or used to categorize data.

:::info Permissions for editing datasets

Dashboards can only be edited by their owner.  One method for multiple users to avoid conflicting dataset modifications would be for
users of shared datasets to create virtual datasets for their own use.

## Editing dashboards

To edit a dashboard, select **Dashboards** from the top menu bar and navigate to the desired dashboard.  Clicking on <div className="button purple_button_dashboard">**EDIT DASHBOARD**</div> allows users
to resize and rearrange the layout of different charts.

Data backing the graphs can be filtered by clicking on the <DashboardFilterIcon /> icon on the left side of the dashboard, selecting <div className="button superset_button"><PlusOutlined /> Add filters and dividers</div> and selecting the SCOPING panel.

:::tip Tables referenced by dashboard filter

The SCOPING tab on the filters modal allows users to specify which graphs the filter applies to.
Note that if 2 charts are backed by different datasets which share a field name, a single filter can 
be used to manipulate both tables simultaneously.
