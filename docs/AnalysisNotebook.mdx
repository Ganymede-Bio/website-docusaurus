Analysis notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that allow users to access and analyze data uploaded to Ganymede Cloud as part of a Flow run.  A fresh notebook instantiation has templates to retrieve data and save notebooks.  To access a fresh notebook instance, go to the <div className="button darkblue_button"><BranchesOutlined /> **Flow Editor**</div> page, click on the **Analysis** button in the header and select `default`.  The image below shows an example of what this notebook would contain:

The first 2 cells in the image provide templates for validating and querying data, while the last cell enables the notebook to be saved to git.

To save the notebook to a different name, modify the `dest` key (i.e. - replace `new_notebook` with the desired notebook name) and execute the cell.

### Installing Python packages

A list of available packages can be retrieved by running

```python
!pip freeze --local
```

Additional packages can be installed using pip magic.  For example, the following command installs a number of analytics and plotting packages:

```python
!pip install scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib pandas_gbq
```

### Loading data from Ganymede data lake

Tables in the environment can be accessed via the Ganymede SDK.  For example, the code below lists available tables:

```python
from ganymede_sdk import Ganymede

g = Ganymede()
tables = g.list_tables()
for table in tables:
    print(table.table_id)
```

To run a query, pass an [ANSI SQL snippet](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) to the __query_sql__ variable and use the __retrieve_sql__ method from Ganymede's query module.  This will return the results as a Pandas DataFrame.  Below is an example of retrieving query results.

```python
q = 'select * from ganymede_demo.demo_table'
```
```python
from ganymede_sdk import Ganymede

g.retrieve_sql(query_sql)
```

### Saving notebooks

The final cell contains a code that commits the notebook to the HEAD of the Github repository containing the stored Flow.  The `src` entry in the `files` dictionary specifies the location of the notebook within the repository, and the `dest` entry specifies the name under which the notebook is committed.

```python
from ganymede_sdk.notebook import save

files = [{'src': 'default', 'dest': 'notebook_to_save_to'}]
save(files)
```
