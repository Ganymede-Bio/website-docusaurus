&nbsp;

To assemble a dashboard:
- [Add a dataset](#adding-a-dataset), either chosen from the environment or via SQL query
- [Create a chart](#creating-a-chart) from the dataset
- [Save the chart](#saving-charts-to-dashboards) to add the chart to the specified dashboard.
- [Modify dashboards and chart layouts](#editing-dashboards) by selecting the corresponding dashboard from the **Dashboards** tab in the top menu bar

## Adding a Dataset

Datasets must be added from the environment prior to charting, either chosen from the environment ([Physical Datasets](#adding-physical-datasets)) or created via an ANSI SQL query ([Virtual Datasets](#adding-virtual-datasets)) based prior to charting.

### Adding Physical Datasets

Physical datasets are tables outputted from flows.  To add a physical dataset:

- Click on the Datasets button in the top bar:

<img alt="Dashboard - Select Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Select_Dataset20230531.png" />

- Select a database, schema, and table to add and click <div className="button darkblue_button">**CREATE DATASET AND CREATE CHART**</div>.

<img alt="Dashboard - Add Physical Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Add_Dataset20230531.png" />

### Adding Virtual Datasets

Virtual datasets for the dashboard environment are constructed by querying existing tables.

- Hover over SQL in the top menu bar and click on SQL Lab.  This should bring you to a SQL editor that lets you preview tables, and results of SQL queries:

<img alt="Dashboard - SQL Editor" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/SQL_Editor20230531.png" />

- Fill in the SQL Editor with a query string, select an appropriate number of rows to observe, and click <div className="button darkblue_button">**RUN**</div> to execute SQL.

<img alt="Dashboard - SQL Editor Query" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/SQL_Editor_Query20230531.png" />

- Save a virtual dataset by clicking on the <div className="button purple_button_dashboard"><DownOutlined /></div> next to the <div className="button purple_button_dashboard">SAVE</div> button, and clicking on <div className="button jupyter_button">Save Dataset</div>.

<img alt="Dashboard - Add Virtual Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/SQL_Editor_Save_Dataset20230531.png" />

For a list of available functions and syntax guidance, please reference the [SQL in BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax).

:::tip Saving queries

The <div className="button purple_button_dashboard">SAVE</div> button saves SQL queries for future edits, but does not register a query as a virtual dataset.

## Creating a chart

Charts can be created from physical or virtual datasets.  

To create a chart:

- Hover over Data in the top menu bar and click on Datasets.  Then, click on one of the listed datasets, which should bring up the following pane:

<img alt="Dashboard - Create Chart" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Create_Chart20230415.png" />

The DATA tab has controls for specifying chart type and pivoting/aggregating data from the selected table.  The customize tab has functionality for annotating axis labels, specifying axis format, and chart title.

### Saving charts to dashboards

- Once the created chart looks satisfactory, add a chart to a dashboard by clicking on **SAVE** in the upper-right hand corner of the screen to bring up this modal:

<img alt="Dashboard - Save Chart" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Save_Chart20230415.png" />

### Calculated columns

Calculated columns can be added to the dataset, which can be handy for correcting data for visualization.  Some example use cases are:

- Taking the floor or ceiling of a variable to truncate data outside of a desired range
- Performing string manipulations on a field to categorize or subset data
- Extracting values from a string for aggregation

To create a calculated column:

- Hover over the three dots to the right of the dataset on the Chart Creation page and click Edit Dataset.

<img alt="Dashboard - Edit Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Edit_Dataset20230415.png" />

- Select the Calculated Columns tab to add new columns to the dataset.  Specify the field definition using a SQL expression.

:::tip Calculated Column flexibility

Calculated columns are more flexible than what is found in other BI tools offering similar functionality.  Beyond aggregation, these fields 
can be filtered on, sorted by, and/or used to categorize data.

:::info Permissions for editing datasets

Dashboards can only be edited by their owner.  One method for multiple users to avoid conflicting dataset modifications would be for
users of shared datasets to create virtual datasets for their own use.

:::

## Editing dashboards

To edit a dashboard, select **Dashboards** from the top menu bar and navigate to the desired dashboard.  Clicking on <div className="button purple_button_dashboard">**EDIT DASHBOARD**</div> allows users
to resize and rearrange the layout of different charts.

Data backing the graphs can be filtered by clicking on the <DashboardFilterIcon /> icon on the left side of the dashboard, selecting <div className="button superset_button"><PlusOutlined /> Add filters and dividers</div> and selecting the SCOPING panel.

:::tip Tables referenced by dashboard filter

The SCOPING tab on the filters modal allows users to specify which graphs the filter applies to.
Note that if 2 charts are backed by different datasets which share a field name, a single filter can 
be used to manipulate both tables simultaneously.

## Tips and tricks

#### How do you create bar plots with proportions and percentages?

In the chart editor page

1. Click the `+ Drop columns/metrics here or click` in the metrics
section of the query. 
2. Move to the **CUSTOM SQL** tab
3. Enter the following formula in the editor space 

```sql
COUNTIF(my_column = 'my_value') / COUNT(*)
```

#### I added a new column but I do not see it in the columns side bar in the editor chart page.
In the chart editor page

1. Click the **â‹®** in the `Chart Source` side bar
2. Click editor `Edit dataset`
3. Click the **COLUMNS** tab
4. Click `SYNC COLUMNS FROM SOURCE`
5. Save

#### I do not see the full range of values on the x-axis of my line plot

This could be due to there being to many digits in the data being displayed, which can be fixed by
rounding the data.

1. Click the column of interest in `X-AXIS` Query section
2. Click the **CUSTOM SQL** tab
3. Modify the sql command to be 
```sql
ROUND(my_column, 2)
```
4. Update chart


#### I am creating a line chart but the line is patchy and not full connected

If the spacing between adjacent data points is too large, superset will have trouble connecting the
points together. You can fill in the data in the chart editor page

1. Expand the `Advanced analytics` section in the `Data` tab
2. Select an option in the `RULE` such as 1 hourly frequency
3. Select the `FILL METHOD` such as Linear interpolation
4. Update chart

Another approach might be to increase the `ROW LIMIT` in the **DATA** tab if you have a large
dataset. 

#### Including headers, text, dividers, and tabs to dashboard

1. In the dashboard page, click `EDIT DASHBOARD` 
2. On the right side of the page, click the `LAYOUT ELEMENTS` tab
3. Drag and drop tabs, text boxes, headers, etc

These can be used to add descriptions to your dashboard. The text boxes and headers are markdown
editors which can include hyperlinks that can point to flow pages or other dashboards. The tabs
allow you to separate out charts into different tabs to group relevant charts together. Filters can
be configured to work with different tabs. Filters that are not relevant to the specific tab you are
on will be hidden under a dropdown and classified as out of scope. Tabs act as their own mini
dashboards with unique links that will point to that tab in the dashboard.
