The <div className="button darkblue_button"><AreaChartOutlined /> **Dashboard**</div> page offers charts and dashboard visualizations based on data stored within Ganymede.

## Adding a Dataset

Datasets must be added from the environment prior to charting, either chosen from the environment ([Physical Datasets](#adding-physical-datasets)) or created via an ANSI SQL query ([Virtual Datasets](#adding-virtual-datasets)).  

In the parlance of other database systems, virtual datasets are sometimes referred to as _views_, while physical datasets are referred to as _tables_.

### Adding Physical Datasets

To make an existing dataset available for use:

- Hover over Data in the menu bar at the top and click on Datasets.

- Click on <div className="button darkblue_button"><PlusOutlined /> **DATASET**</div> and select a table to make it available for charting.

### Adding Virtual Datasets

Virtual datasets are created by ANSI SQL query; for a list of available functions and syntax guidance, please reference the [SQL in BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax).

To create a virtual dataset:

- Hover over SQL Lab in the top menu bar and click on SQL Editor.  This should bring you to a SQL editor that lets you preview tables, and results of SQL queries:

- Fill in the SQL Editor with a query string, select an appropriate number of rows to observe, and click <div className="button darkblue_button">**RUN**</div> to execute SQL.

- Save a virtual dataset by clicking on the **Create Chart** button, which should bring up the following modal:

<img alt="Dashboard - Add Virtual Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Add_Virtual_Dataset20230415.png" />

:::info Saving queries

The **SAVE** button saves SQL queries for future edits, but does not register a query as a virtual dataset.

## Creating a chart

Charts can be created from physical or virtual datasets.  

To create a chart:

- Hover over Data in the top menu bar and click on Datasets.  Then, click on one of the listed datasets, which should bring up the following pane:

The DATA tab has controls for specifying chart type and pivoting/aggregating data from the selected table.  The customize tab has functionality for annotating axis labels, specifying axis format, and chart title.

- Once the created chart looks satisfactory, add a chart to a dashboard by clicking on **SAVE** in the upper-right hand corner of the screen to bring up this modal:

### Calculated columns

Calculated columns can be added to the dataset, which can be handy for correcting data for visualization.  Some example use cases are:

- Taking the floor or ceiling of a variable to truncate data outside of a desired range
- Performing string manipulations on a field to categorize or subset data
- Extracting values from a string for aggregation

To create a calculated column:

- Hover over the three dots to the right of the dataset on the Chart Creation page and click Edit Dataset.

- Select the Calculated Columns tab to add new columns to the dataset.  Specify the field definition using a SQL expression.
