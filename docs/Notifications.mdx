The notifications table provides the following information per event.

- **Type**: Events of type _SAVE_ are created when _flows_ are saved and events of type _RUN_ are created when flows are run.
- **Flow Name**: Name of the _flow_ that was saved or run. Search bar is provided for filtering on specific flows.
- **Date / Time**: The date and time the event was created.
- **Status**: The following are the status types:
    - **Processing**: Event was kicked off and is processing. Processing _SAVE_ events will disable users from running flows as the entire environment is saved and deployed when a user saves a flow. Once all _SAVE_ events are out of the _PROCESSING_ state, flow runs will be available again.
    - **Completed**: Event completed successfully. 
    - **Flow Error**: Only possible for events of type _RUN_. This means a flow run failed and the detailed logs can be viewed on the [Flow Runs page](FlowRuns.mdx).
    - **Error**: An unexpected error occurred on our end. Users should retry the operation or contact Ganymede Support for assistance.
    - **Timeout**: Notification timed out 180 seconds after event start.  Users should check the _flow_ that triggered the event for the latest status or try again.
- **User**: User login triggering the associated event
