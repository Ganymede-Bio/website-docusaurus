This guide walks through how to install, build, and configure a [Ganymede Agent](./connectivity/Agent.mdx), a locally installed program that captures data from lab instruments for processing.

## 

In the navigation pane, there is a new “Connections” tab. All agent connections will be visible here. To create a new agent, click the New button on the right side of the Connections page.
