The <div className="button darkblue_button"><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/flows_icon.svg')} className="filter-white" /> **Flow View**</div> page provides access to running flows and viewing run history.  You can access this page by clicking on a Flow on the <div className="button darkblue_button"><HomeOutlined /> **Home**</div> page.

## Running flows

To run a Flow, drop a file into the upload box and click the <div className="button run_queue_button">**Run** <PlayCircleOutlined /></div> button on the left side of the run box.

## Flow status indicators

The Flow View page provides detailed status indicators at both the Flow and node levels to help you track the progress and outcomes of your Flows.

### Flow-level status

The Run History table displays status information for each historical run:

- **File**: The input files and parameters associated with the flow run.
- **Run Tag**: Tags associated with the flow run, such as a Benchling custom entity ID used to reference a table within Benchling.
- **Status**: The current status of the flow run. Possible status values include:
  - Running: The job is currently in progress.
  - Success: All nodes have successfully completed.
  - Failed: At least one node failed to complete successfully.

### Node-level status

You can click the plus sign on the left side of each record in the Run History table to expand the view and display node-level status.

The color of the node status indicators reflects the current status:
- ![#B22222](https://placehold.co/2x2/B22222/B22222.png) **Red**: The node failed after retries were exhausted.
- ![#01FF70](https://placehold.co/2x2/01FF70/01FF70.png) **Light green**: The node is currently running.
- ![#2ECC40](https://placehold.co/2x2/2ECC40/2ECC40.png) **Dark green**: The node successfully completed.
- ![#A9A9A9](https://placehold.co/2x2/A9A9A9/A9A9A9.png) **Gray**: The node is queued and awaiting system resource to start.
- ![#FFFF00](https://placehold.co/2x2/FFFF00/FFFF00.png) **Yellow**: The node failed at least once but is awaiting a retry.
- ![#9932CC](https://placehold.co/2x2/9932CC/9932CC.png) **Dark Orchid**: The node was skipped before completion.  This may be intended behavior for nodes downstream of a [Branch_Python](./nodes/Analysis/Branch_Python.md) node, but may also indicate a system resource limitation.  If the issue is system resource-related, please reach out to [Ganymede Support](./Support.mdx).
- ![#FFA500](https://placehold.co/2x2/FFA500/FFA500.png) **Orange**: A dependency for the node failed, preventing this node from running.

Logs for each flow step can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding colored box.

### Error Attribution

Developers using the platform can specify error types and messages associated with failed nodes. These are displayed on the status tag in the Run History table. Below is an example code snippet that would be placed within a node to raise an error:

```python
from ganymede_sdk.flow_runtime import GanymedeException

# available exception types are: Validation, Connection, Function
raise GanymedeException(message=”Peaks not detected in results”, exception_type=”Function”)
```

#### Categories of Errors

- **Validation**: Schema validation errors. An example use case would be a Pandas DataFrame failing to validate against a Pandera schema.
- **Connection**: Errors related to connecting to external services. Check for errors related to authentication, service availability, and access methods.
- **Function**: Errors related to function logic. For example, a failed function call to a Python package would fall under this category.
