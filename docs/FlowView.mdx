The <div className="button darkblue_button"><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/flows_icon.svg')} className="filter-white" /> **Flow View**</div> page provides access to running flows and viewing run history.  This page can be accessed by clicking on a _flow_ on the <div className="button darkblue_button"><HomeOutlined /> **Home**</div> page.

## Running flows

To run a _flow_, drop a file into the upload box and click the <div className="button run_queue_button">**Run** <PlayCircleOutlined /></div> button on the left side of the run box.

## Flow status indicators

### Flow-level status

The Run History table contains the following status information on historical runs:

- **File**: Input files and input parameters associated with _flow_ run
- **Run Tag**: Run tags associated with _flow_ run. An example run tag would be a Benchling custom entity ID used to reference a table within Benchling.
- **Status**: Run status for a _flow_ run instance.  Possible status values are: 
  - Running: Job is in the process of running
  - Success: All _nodes_ have run successfully
  - Failed: At least one _node_ has failed to run successfully

### Node-level status

Clicking on the plus sign found on the left hand side of each Run History table record expands the view to display _node_-level status.  

Some common values for colors that you will see are:
  - ![#B22222](https://placehold.co/2x2/B22222/B22222.png) **Red**: failure after retries exhausted
  - ![#01FF70](https://placehold.co/2x2/01FF70/01FF70.png) **Light green**: currently running
  - ![#2ECC40](https://placehold.co/2x2/2ECC40/2ECC40.png) **Dark green**: successful run
  - ![#A9A9A9](https://placehold.co/2x2/A9A9A9/A9A9A9.png) **Gray**: queued; awaiting system resource to commence
  - ![#FFFF00](https://placehold.co/2x2/FFFF00/FFFF00.png) **Yellow**: failure to run on at least 1 try; awaiting retry
  - ![#9932CC](https://placehold.co/2x2/9932CC/9932CC.png) **Dark Orchid**: skipped prior to completion; this color may indicate a system resource limitation
  - ![#FFA500](https://placehold.co/2x2/FFA500/FFA500.png) **Orange**: dependency for node has failed, preventing this node from being run

Logs associated with each _flow_ step can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding colored box.

#### Error Attribution

Developers on the platform are able to throw specify an error type and message associated with a failed _node_, as shown
in the example code below, which would live within a node.  The type is displayed on the status tag of the Run History table.

```python
from ganymede_sdk.flow_runtime import GanymedeException

# available exception types are: Validation, Connection, Function
raise GanymedeException(message=”Peaks not detected in results”, exception_type=”Function”)
```

Categories of errors are:

- **Validation**: Schema validation errors; an example use case would be a Pandas DataFrame failing to validate against a Pandera schema.
- **Connection**: Errors related to connecting to external services.  Check for errors related to authentication, service availability, and how the service is being accessed.
- **Function**: Errors related to function logic; an example use case would be a failed function call to a Python package.
