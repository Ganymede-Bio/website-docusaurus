The <div className="button border_button"><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/flows_icon.svg')} className="filter-white" /> **Flow View**</div> page provides access to running _flows_ and viewing run history.  This page can be accessed by clicking on a _flow_ on the <div className="button border_button"><HomeOutlined /> **Home**</div> page.

## Running flows

To run a _flow_, drop a file into the upload box and click the <div className="button border_button">Run <CaretRightOutlined /></div> button on the left side of the run box.

### Watching directories for new files

An alternative way to load files into Ganymede flows is to watch a directory.  This feature enables users to define a directory that is monitored for new file additions or modifications.  New files that appear in the directory are queued, enabling hands-free usage of Ganymede. 

To setup a directory watcher, open up a _flow_ on the <div className="button border_button"><HomeOutlined /> **Home**</div> page or via the <div className="button border_button"><NodeIndexOutlined /> **Flow Editor**</div> page. The <div className="button dark_gray_button"><PlusCircleOutlined className="tree_node_icon"/> **Flow_Inputs**</div> *node* consists of a form input for all input types that have been defined for the _flow_.  Inputs that take files have a <div className="button light_blue_button"><FolderViewOutlined /></div> icon that is used to select which directory needs to be watched.

#### Configuring directory watching

The watcher can be configured by clicking on the gear icon.  This produces a modal with two settings, the observation mode and the write mode.

The observation mode specifies which files are captured:
 - **Differential mode** detects files that are created or modified in a directory after the watcher is started.
 - **Cumulative mode** queues any files incorporate any files that already exist in the directory, and proceeds to look for any new files created or modified in the selected directory.

The write mode describes how Ganymede Cloud handles observed files.  When the watcher detects a file, it will upload to our system independent of its mode. If a detected file has the same file name as one that already exists in our system for a given flow and input, there are two ways the watcher can move forward. The first is to queue the file already in our system to run. The second is to upload the file into our system with a unique name.

</div>

Once the watcher is configured, close out of the modal and click the file icon to select directory. The watcher will now continue to observe that directory until a user refreshes or closes the site or select the 'X' icon that appears when watching a file.
 
## Flow status indicators

### Flow-level status

The Run History table contains the following status information on historical runs:

- **File**: Input files and input parameters associated with _flow_ run
- **Run Tag**: Run tags associated with _flow_ run. An example run tag would be a Benchling custom entity ID used to reference a table within Benchling.
- **Status**: Run status for a _flow_ run instance.  Possible status values are: 
  - Running: Job is in the process of running
  - Success: All _nodes_ have run successfully
  - Failed: At least one _node_ has failed to run successfully

### Node-level status

<img alt="Node status indicator" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/apiServer/NodeStatusAndLog_20230109.png" />

Clicking on the plus sign found on the left hand side of each Run History table record expands the view to display _node_-level status.  

Some common values for colors that you will see are:
  - ![#B22222](https://placehold.co/2x2/B22222/B22222.png) **Red**: failure after retries exhausted
  - ![#01FF70](https://placehold.co/2x2/01FF70/01FF70.png) **Light green**: currently running
  - ![#2ECC40](https://placehold.co/2x2/2ECC40/2ECC40.png) **Dark green**: successful run
  - ![#A9A9A9](https://placehold.co/2x2/A9A9A9/A9A9A9.png) **Gray**: queued; awaiting system resource to commence
  - ![#FFFF00](https://placehold.co/2x2/FFFF00/FFFF00.png) **Yellow**: failure to run on at least 1 try; awaiting retry
  - ![#9932CC](https://placehold.co/2x2/9932CC/9932CC.png) **Dark Orchid**: skipped prior to completion; this color may indicate a system resource limitation
  - ![#FFA500](https://placehold.co/2x2/FFA500/FFA500.png) **Orange**: dependency for node has failed, preventing this node from being run

Logs associated with each _flow_ step can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding colored box.
