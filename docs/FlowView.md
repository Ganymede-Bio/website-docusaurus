## Summary

The Flow View provides access to run functionality and run history for each _Flow_.

For more information on the run functionality, see the [Flow Runs page](FlowRuns.md).

To view the results of current and historical runs, the Runs History table provides the following information per run:

- **Overall run status**: The status of the overall _Flow_ run, input file used in the run, and run tag (if provided).
- **Functions run status**: The status of each function within a _Flow_. This can be viewed by expanding the table.
- **Metadata about the run**: Execution date, start date, and end data of the run. This can be viewed by expanding the table.
- **Logs (Coming soon)**: Logs associated with the flow and function run statuses to help users gain more insight and debug.
