- The Data Lake Tables pane contains a list of tables that exist in the current environment. 
  - There is a search bar to filter tables that contain the search string
  - The button next to table overwrites the SQL query in the top right and give an example query

- The Query Editor provides an input window for users to type in queries.
  - This query is limited to data query (DQL) calls only. (e.g. `SELECT` are the only keyword allowed in the query)
  - Table names should be surrounded with backticks - use <div className="keystroke">`</div> to escape special characters
  - If the `LIMIT` keyword is not included, a default of limit of 1000 records is inserted to limit loading time.
  
- The Results pane contains the query results
  - There is a download button on the top right which takes the current output and produces a CSV file
