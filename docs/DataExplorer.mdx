The <div className="button darkblue_button"><TableOutlined /> **Data Explorer**</div> page offers access to tabular data generated from Ganymede flows or from other sources.

- The **Explorer** pane contains a list of tables in the current environment. 
  - There is a search bar to filter the list to tables that contain the given search string.
  - There is an <img className="inline-img" src="img/data/addTableButton.png"/> button that lets you create a new table with a name and schema that you specify, using the [Table Structure Editor](TableStructureEditor).
- The rest of the window has various tabs that let you view or modify the selected table.
  - The **Fields** tab lets you view and edit the table structure (the defined columns of the table, aka schema) and other table metadata, including a description.

    - Fields have a name, a datatype (STRING by default), a flag for whether they are required, and an optional description.
    - You can edit a schema with the [Table Structure Editor](TableStructureEditor) <img className="inline-img" src="img/data/editButton.png"/> button. In Edit mode, you can edit the table description, and add fields and change some of the field information. 

  - The **Preview** tab displays the first 10 data rows of the selected table.

  - The **Query** tab allows you to do SQL queries on the table.

    - You specify the query in **Query Editor** pane, which is preloaded with a default query for the selected table.  In the query, table names should be surrounded with backticks. (Why?) Only `SELECT` statements are allowed.
    
    - The **Results** pane shows the result of the query. There is a download button on the top right which will produce a CSV file based on the results.

  - The **Flows** tab shows Ganymede Flows that are associated with this table. Clicking on the links in the Flow Id column will take you to the appropriate page.
