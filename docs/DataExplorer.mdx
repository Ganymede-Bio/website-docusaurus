<img width="1251" alt="DataExplorer" src="img/data/page.png"/>

- The Explorer pane contains a list of tables in the current environment. 
  - There is a search bar to filter tables that contain the search string
- The rest of the window has various tabs that let you view or modify the selected table.
  - The Fields tab lets you view and edit the table schema (the defined columns of the table) and other table metadata, including a description.

  - The Preview tab displays the first 10 rows of the selected table.

  - The Query tab provides an input window for users to type in queries.
    - This query is limited to data query (DQL) calls only. (e.g. `SELECT` are the only keyword allowed in the query)
  - Table names should be surrounded with backticks - use <div className="keystroke">`</div> to escape special characters
    
    - The Results pane contains the query results. There is a download button on the top right which takes the current output and produces a CSV file

  - The Flows tab shows Flows that are associated with this table. Clicking on the link will take you to the appropriate page
