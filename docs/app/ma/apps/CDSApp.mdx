The Chromatography app provides functionality to collect, process, and interpret chromatographic data from analytical and biopharma laboratories. This vendor-agnostic solution supports HPLC, UHPLC, GC, and other chromatography instruments, as well as capillary electrophoresis systems (CE-SDS), enabling standardized analysis workflows across your organization for both chromatograms and electropherograms.

## Overview

The Chromatography app transforms how laboratories interact with chromatography data by providing real-time visualization, intelligent peak detection, and quality control tracking in a single unified interface. Users can review, validate, and adjust peak integration results while maintaining full audit trails for compliance requirements.

### Common Use Cases

The Chromatography app excels in various analytical scenarios:

- **Stability Studies** — Track degradation products and impurity profiles over time
- **Method Transfer and Validation** — Ensure consistent results across laboratories and instruments
- **QC Batch Release Testing** — Streamline routine quality control analyses
- **Forced Degradation Studies** — Identify and quantify degradation pathways
- **Bioanalytical Method Development** — Optimize separation conditions and detection parameters
- **Process Analytical Technology (PAT)** — Monitor critical quality attributes in real-time

The features shown below provide a representative set of capabilities available in the Chromatography app. Your implementation will be tailored to your specific use case, workflows, and analytical requirements.

## Data Types Analyzed

The Chromatography app processes and manages multiple types of analytical data:

### Raw Signal and Chromatogram Data
- **Detector signal intensity vs. time** — the chromatogram itself from UV, MS, RID, FLD detectors
- **Baseline signal** — noise, drift, and background correction data
- **Integration results** — automatically or manually defined peak boundaries
- **Retention time (RT)** — time taken for each analyte to elute
- **Peak area and height** — proportional to analyte concentration
- **Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)** — used for quantitation limits

### Processed and Derived Data
- **Concentrations and quantities** based on calibration curves
- **Relative retention times (RRTs)** for method comparison
- **Resolution (Rs) and tailing factors** for peak shape assessment
- **Percent area or composition** — for purity and related substances testing
- **Method validation metrics** — accuracy, precision, linearity, LOD/LOQ
- **Derived chromatograms** — overlay plots, averaged runs, normalized signals

### Calibration and Reference Data
- **Calibration standards** and **standard curves** for quantitative accuracy
- **Internal standard ratios** for normalization
- **System suitability parameters (SST)** — retention time repeatability, peak symmetry
- **Instrument response factors** and dilution factors

### Sample and Metadata
