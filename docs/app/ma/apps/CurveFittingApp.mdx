The Curve Fitting app within the Ganymede platform provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing dose-response, standard curves, and binding assays. This specialized application automates regression analysis while enabling interactive outlier management and maintaining complete audit trails. The app supports various regression models including linear, 4-parameter logistic (4PL), 5-parameter logistic (5PL), and custom equations, enabling standardized curve fitting workflows across your organization.

## Overview

As part of the Ganymede data platform, the Curve Fitting app transforms how laboratories analyze concentration-response data by providing interactive visualization, automated regression fitting, and outlier management in a single unified interface. The app eliminates manual curve fitting in spreadsheets while ensuring consistency across different users and experiments. Users can iteratively refine fits, document exclusion decisions, and generate validated results while maintaining full traceability for regulatory compliance.

### Common Use Cases

The Curve Fitting app excels in various analytical scenarios:

- **Dose-Response Analysis** — Determine IC50/EC50 values for drug discovery
