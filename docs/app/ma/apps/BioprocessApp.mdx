# The Bioprocess Application

The bioprocess application enables users to aggregate, visualize, and analyze measurements from bioreactor samples.

In this demo, we will:
1. Visualize online and atline data for a bioreactor experiment
2. Overlay multiple experiments to evaluate batch-to-batch variation
3. Estimate growth rate and doubling time via regression
4. Visualize and explore correlation and PCA analyses
5. Visualize and explore results of a partial least squares (PLS) analysis
6. Identify anomalies across bioprocess parameters via an isolation forest
7. Design a bioprocess experiment using PLS optimized parameters

:::note
The instructions and components used in this application can be readily configured by you or our [Implementation team](../../Support.mdx) to suit your specific process and analysis.

Some examples of out-of-the-box customizations are:
- Model choices for growth rate estimation
- Tailored monitored parameters across bioprocess experiments
- Partial least squares response and predictor variables

## Demo App Walkthrough

The following walkthrough will guide you through all components of Ganymede's Bioprocess Modular Analysis offering. The walkthrough is split into four sections, corresponding to the four highest-level tabs available in the app: Online Data, Atline Data, Analysis, and Experimental Design.

### Online Data

The Online Data section of the Bioprocess app provides visualizations of real-time measurements collected during bioreactor operation. Measurements can be used to trigger alerts when process parameters drift out of range.

1. Measurements are presented as individual line plots with the option to overlay multiple experiments. All plots share the same x-axis and are synced as you zoom in/out. Hover over individual points to see details about a specific measurement.

          width="90%"
    />
</div>

2. By default, the online data tab displays the 3 most recent experiments overlaid. The red, dashed lines represent boundaries used to identify outliers. Thresholds are unique to each process parameter and can be set based on a method of your choosing. When an outlier is detected, an email alert is sent to email addresses specified in Ganymede.

          width="80%"
    />
</div>
&nbsp;

### Analysis

The Analysis section of the Bioprocess app provides exploratory visualizations of analyses performed in Ganymede Flows. Analyses performed include:

1. Correlation analysis to identify relationships between process parameters
2. Principal component analysis to identify sources of variation that impact process performance
3. Partial least squares regression to characterize and predict process outcomes based on parameter values
4. Growth rate estimation via regression

Beyond exploration, the Analysis section enables human-in-the-loop workflows that maintain data traceability.

1. The Analysis section is separated by a series of sub-tabs: Cell Culture Growth Kinetics, Process Investigation, Process Optimization and Modeling, and Outlier Detection.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img

          width="80%"
    />
</div>
&nbsp;

8. Model accuracy can be evaluated via a correlation plot of predicted outcomes vs. measured values. The PLS model is trained to predict a series of response variables which can each be changed via the Modeled Variable dropdown. Updating the Modeled Variable selection updates the underlying data for the correlation plot, contour plot, and model weights.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img
          alt="Bioprocess Model Evaluation and Contour"
          src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ganymede-bio-website/public/ma/bioprocess_model_evaluation_and_contour.png"
          width="80%"
    />
</div>
&nbsp;

9. The predicted value landscape is visualized via contour plots. Toggle predictor variables by updating Predictor Variable Select 1 and 2.

10. Predictor variable importances and weights are displayed via bar charts. Note that the PLS model importances are calculated against the entire set of response variables, thus importances reflect how each process parameter affects both growth and product titer. Model training methods can be modified based on your needs.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img
          alt="Bioprocess PLS Importances and Weights"
