The Bioprocess app transforms bioreactor monitoring by unifying real-time online and atline data into customizable, role-specific dashboards that accelerate decision-making from bench to production scale. This vendor-agnostic solution supports all major bioreactor platforms, enabling standardized monitoring workflows across your organization.

## Overview

The Bioprocess app revolutionizes how laboratories interact with bioreactor data by providing immediate access to both online sensor measurements and atline analytical results in a single, unified interface. Users can monitor critical process parameters in real-time, visualize trends across multiple runs, and leverage advanced analytics for process optimization — all while maintaining complete data traceability for regulatory compliance.

What sets the Bioprocess app apart is its ability to deliver customized visualizations for different user groups. Operators see real-time deviations and alarms, scientists access detailed analytical tools, and management views high-level KPIs — all from the same underlying data platform. This rapid visualization capability means teams can identify issues, compare batches, and make data-driven decisions faster than ever before.
