The qPCR app within the Ganymede platform provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing quantitative PCR data from gene expression and viral load studies. This specialized application automates the complex calculations required for qPCR analysis (quantitative real-time PCR), a molecular biology technique used to amplify and simultaneously detect targeted DNA molecules. The app supports both qPCR and RT-qPCR (reverse transcription qPCR) experiments, enabling standardized analysis workflows across your organization.

## Overview

As part of the Ganymede data platform, the qPCR app transforms how laboratories analyze gene expression data by providing interactive visualization, automated ΔΔCt calculations, and multi-condition analysis in a single unified interface. The app eliminates the need for error-prone spreadsheet calculations while ensuring consistency across different users and experiments. Users can analyze complex experimental designs, normalize data across multiple reference genes and controls, and generate publication-ready visualizations while maintaining full traceability for regulatory compliance.

### Common Use Cases

The qPCR app excels in various qPCR analytical scenarios:
