If you have a list of instruments to upload, they can be easily uploaded in one go using the 
Bulk Upload Instruments feature. 

To use it, download the template CSV file in the bulk upload instruments form and fill it out by adding 
one instrument per row. For the most part, the same rules apply to each field in the bulk upload form as 
they do in the single instrument upload form. 

<i><b>One important difference</b></i> is that the "Connection Id" column takes a Connection Id instead of a name which 
is displayed in the single instrument form Connection dropdown.

If there's any issue detected within the uploaded CSV file, none of the rows will be saved as Instruments. 
A descriptive error message will explain what's wrong with the file.
