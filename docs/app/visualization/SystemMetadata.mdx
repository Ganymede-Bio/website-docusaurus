Ganymede metadata tables allow users to query and reference details about flow runs, tables, and files stored within the Ganymede platform. These tables can be utilized for various purposes, such as debugging previous runs, locating specific files or table records associated with past runs, and systematically displaying tags used to contextualize and ensure traceability of captured data.

The tables described below are found in the Ganymede database under the metadata schema, and can be referenced in [Dashboards](../visualization/Dashboards.mdx).

## Flow Runs

The **flow_run_metadata** table captures a record for each flow execution.
