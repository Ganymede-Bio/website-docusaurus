The <div className="button darkblue_button"><AreaChartOutlined /> **Dashboard**</div> page offers charts and dashboard visualizations based on data stored within Ganymede.  

<img alt="Ganymede Dashboard" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/apiServer/Dashboard_20230831.png" />
&nbsp;

To assemble a dashboard:
- [Add a dataset](#adding-a-dataset) from the environment or create one via SQL query.
- [Create a chart](#creating-a-chart) from the dataset.
- [Save the chart](#saving-charts-to-dashboards) to a specified dashboard.
- [Modify dashboards and chart layouts](#editing-dashboards) by selecting the corresponding dashboard from the **Dashboards** tab in the top menu bar.

## Adding a Dataset

Before creating charts, you will need to add datasets from the environment.  These can be either ([Physical Datasets](#adding-physical-datasets)) or [Virtual Datasets](#adding-virtual-datasets) (created via an ANSI SQL query).

### Adding Physical Datasets

Physical datasets are outputted by Flows.  To add a physical dataset:

- Click on the Datasets button in the top bar:

<img alt="Dashboard - Select Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Select_Dataset20230531.png" />

- Choose a database, schema, and table. Then click <div className="button darkblue_button">**CREATE DATASET AND CREATE CHART**</div>.

<img alt="Dashboard - Add Physical Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Add_Dataset20230531.png" />

### Adding Virtual Datasets

Virtual datasets are created by querying existing tables in Ganymede.

- Hover over SQL in the top menu bar and click on SQL Lab.  This should bring you to a SQL editor, where you can preview tables and run SQL queries.

<img alt="Dashboard - SQL Editor" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/SQL_Editor20230531.png" />

- Enter your SQL query, select the number of rows to preview, and click <div className="button darkblue_button">**RUN**</div> to execute the query.

<img alt="Dashboard - SQL Editor Query" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/SQL_Editor_Query20230531.png" />

- To save the virtual dataset, click the <div className="button purple_button_dashboard"><DownOutlined /></div> next to the <div className="button purple_button_dashboard">SAVE</div> button, and select <div className="button jupyter_button">Save Dataset</div>.

<img alt="Dashboard - Add Virtual Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/SQL_Editor_Save_Dataset20230531.png" />

For a list of available functions and syntax guidance, please reference the [SQL in BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax).

:::tip Saving queries

The <div className="button purple_button_dashboard">SAVE</div> button saves SQL queries for future edits, but does not register a query as a virtual dataset.

:::

## Creating a chart

Charts can be created from physical or virtual datasets.  

To create a chart:

- Hover over **Data** in the top menu bar and click on **Datasets**.  Select a dataset from the list, which will open the chart creation pane:

<img alt="Dashboard - Create Chart" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Create_Chart20230415.png" />

- Use the DATA tab to specify chart type and to pivot or aggregate data.  The CUSTOMIZE tab allows you to annotate axis labels, specify axis formats, and set the chart title.

### Saving charts to dashboards

Once the created chart is ready, click **SAVE** in the upper-right hand corner to add it to a dashboard:

<img alt="Dashboard - Save Chart" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Save_Chart20230415.png" />

### Calculated columns

Calculated columns are useful for refining data visualization. Examples include:

- Taking the floor or ceiling of a variable to truncate data outside of a desired range
- Categorizing or subsetting data through string manipulation
- Extracting values for aggregation

To create a calculated column:

- Hover over the three dots to the right of the dataset on the Chart Creation page and click **Edit Dataset**.

<img alt="Dashboard - Edit Dataset" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/dashboard/Edit_Dataset20230415.png" />

- Select the Calculated Columns tab to add new columns to the dataset.  Specify the field definition using a SQL expression.

:::tip Calculated Column flexibility

Calculated columns are more flexible than what is found in other BI tools offering similar functionality.  Beyond aggregation, these fields 
can be filtered on, sorted by, and/or used to categorize data.

## Adding Jinja Templates to SQL Queries

There are two ways to use [Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) in SQL queries:

1. [Virtual Queries](#adding-virtual-datasets)
2. Metrics

### Example Using Virtual Queries

An example virtual query that inherits inputs from a filter can be constructed to use Jinja
templates using:

```sql
{% set variable_name = filter_values('some_column_name')[0] if filter_values('some_column_name') else 1 %}

SELECT 
  *, 
  {{ variable_name }} AS inherited_filter_value,
  value * {{ variable_name }} AS value_multiplied_by_inherited_filter_value
FROM table_name
```

In this example, a variable is set by calling the _filter_values_ function, a function native to the dashboard environment. 
The first value chosen is returned, since _filter_values_ returns a list of selected values by default. 
The if statement checks to see a filtered value was  selected on column `some_column_name` and returns 1 otherwise. 
This assigns a default value to the query so that the dataset can be created and not raise any errors if there are no active
filtered values present on that column. A dataset will not be savable without the if statement.
After saving the query to a virtual dataset, any chart in a dashboard will have the Jinja template automatically be rendered.


### Examples Using Metrics
Creating a chart, a line chart for instance, requires creating a metric on that variable. You can
use filter values by either referencing the new column created in a virtual query or by making the
metric as follows:

```sql
AVG(value * {{ filter_values('some_column_name')[0] if filter_values('some_column_name') else 1}})
```

Where this mimics what was done in the virtual dataset above but instead works for both virtual and
physical datasets. The if statement is required here as well in order for the chart to be displayed
when a filter is not selected on `some_column_name`.


### Notes

Its important to make sure that you have 
1. if statements to check if a filter value is present
2. You are referencing the column name that is being filtered on in the dashboard  
  a. For instance you have a filter defined in the dashboard named `My Filter` created on dataset
`my_dataset` on column `some_column_name` where `some_column_name` is referenced in the Jinja
template
3. The column name is not contained in the dataset you are using the Jinja template in (unless you actually want your chart to be filtered as well) 
4. You may need to wrap your Jinja template in a CAST to convert to INT or NUMERIC if necessary

## Editing dashboards

To edit a dashboard:
- Select **Dashboards** from the top menu bar and navigate to the desired dashboard.  Click <div className="button purple_button_dashboard">**EDIT DASHBOARD**</div> to resize and rearrange the layout of different charts.
- To filter data within graphs, click the <DashboardFilterIcon /> icon on the left side of the dashboard, then select <div className="button superset_button"><PlusOutlined /> Add filters and dividers</div> and use the SCOPING panel to apply filters.

:::info Permissions for editing datasets

Dashboards can only be edited by their owner(s).  One method for multiple users to avoid conflicting dataset modifications would be for
users of shared datasets to create virtual datasets for their own use.

:::

:::tip Tables referenced by dashboard filter

The SCOPING tab on the filters modal allows users to specify which graphs the filter applies to.
Note that if 2 charts are backed by different datasets which share a field name, a single filter can 
be used to manipulate both tables simultaneously.
