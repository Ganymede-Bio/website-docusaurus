The Instruments page allows you to track equipment within Ganymede, with or without connectivity to the instrument.  This offers a quick way to statefully track instruments and view integration status for instruments with connectivity to Ganymede.

&nbsp;
Each instrument can be associated with a [Connection](../agents/Agent.mdx), which allows you to monitor instrument uptime and programmatically interact with the lab instrument.

### Adding instruments

New instruments can be added by clicking on the  <div className="button darkblue_outline_button"><PlusOutlined /> New Instrument</div>  button to open New Instrument form, shown below.

The New Instrument Form allows you to populate instrument characteristics relevant for tracking. The only required field is the **Name** field, which must be unique within the environment.

### Adding instruments in bulk

If you have a list of instruments to upload, you can upload them using the Bulk Upload Instruments feature.

To use this feature, download the template CSV file in the bulk upload instruments form and fill it out, adding 
one instrument per row. 

Upon upload, the CSV file will be validated by Ganymede. If any errors are found, a descriptive error message is displayed, explaining the issue.

:::note
The "Connection Id" column in the instrument bulk upload template file requires Connection ID.  This differs from the form for adding instruments individually, which requests a Connection name from a dropdown list.  Connection ID can be found on the Connection page.
