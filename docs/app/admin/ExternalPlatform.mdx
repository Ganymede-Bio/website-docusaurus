## Platform Integration Details

The Integration panel contains details about the Ganymede environment, which can be used for integration with external systems, as well as for IP whitelisting Ganymede.

- **Notebook IP address**: IP address for hosted notebook environments
- **Flow Runtime IP address**: IP address for workflow orchestration
- **Notebook Service Account Email**: Service account for notebooks
- **Flow Runtime Service Account Email**: Service account for workflow orchestration
- **AWS Trust Policy JSON**: Role configuration for AWS Policy, to establish connectivity between AWS and Ganymede cloud
- **AWS Bucket CORS**: CORS configuration for AWS S3 buckets


### Connecting to an S3 Bucket

In order to allow Ganymede Flows to read and write to an S3 bucket, follow the steps below for each Ganymede environment that needs access to the bucket:

1. Identify which S3 buckets you would like to connect to Ganymede
2. Create a Policy that allows the desired access to the bucket(s), replacing `my-bucket` with the name of the bucket(s) you would like to connect to.

   Example:

    ```json
      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Sid": "ListObjectsInBucket",
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:ListBucket"
                  ],
                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
                  ]
              },
              {
                  "Sid": "AllObjectActions",
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "s3:*Object",
                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }
    ```

3. Record the identity number of the Ganymede Environment
  - Navigate to the Environment Settings page
  - Select the Integration tab
  - Record the number in the `accounts.google.com:aud` field

4. Create the Role in AWS
  - In the IAM console, select Roles > Create Role
  - Select 'Web Identity'
  - Select 'Google' as the Identity Provider
  - Enter the identity number from above as the audience
  - Press Next
  - Select the Policy you created above as the permissions for the Role
  - Press Next 
  - Name the role something like 'ganymede-storage-access'
  - Press Create Role

5. Add the Role ARN as an [environment secret in the Ganymede environment](./AdminControls.mdx#secrets-panel) named _aws_s3_role_arn_.

### Connecting to Ganymede from an External Tool

Ganymede can generate Service Account credentials for use with other tools, such as BigQuery or ODBC. Access using these credentials is restricted to read-only data of the environment in which they were generated.

Some examples of tools that can be connected to Ganymede using this approach include:

#### Dashboarding Tools
- [Tableau](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_googlebigquery.htm)
- [Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/db-config-google-bigquery)
- [PowerBI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/google-bigquery)

#### Data Analysis Tools
- [Posit Connect (R)](https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/databases/big-query/)
- [Spotfire](https://www.cdata.com/kb/tech/bigquery-odbc-spotfire.rst)
- [JMP](https://community.jmp.com/t5/Discussions/ODBC-connection-to-Google-BigQuery/td-p/346253)
- [MATLAB](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-google-bigquery/blob/main/Documentation/BasicUsage.md)
- [Excel](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/bigquery/how-to-connect-bigquery-to-microsoft-excel-and-other-apps-with-our-new-odbc-driver)

#### Generating Service Account Credentials

To do this, follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to the Environment Settings page, Integration tab
<img alt="Admin - Integration Panel Add Credentials" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/apiServer/ExportCredentals_NewCredentials20241114.png" />
2. Select 'New Credentials' and enter a description and name for the Credentials
3. Click 'Create'
<img alt="Admin - Integration Panel Copy Key" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/apiServer/ExportCredentals_CopyKey20241114.png" />
4. Copy the JSON key that is displayed and save it to a file.

:::note

This key is only displayed once, so be sure to save it in a secure location.

:::

:::warning

Treat this key as a password, as it provides access to the Ganymede environment.

:::

5. Use the JSON key to authenticate with the external tool.
