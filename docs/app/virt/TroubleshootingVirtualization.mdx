#### Issue: I have the virtualization session open, but am unable to input text into the virtualization session.

Make sure that your mouse cursor is hovering over the virtualization session, and move your mouse slightly on the page.

The source of this issue is a security feature to guard against keyloggers for remote desktop sessions.
