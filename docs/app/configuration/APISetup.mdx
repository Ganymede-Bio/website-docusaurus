Ganymede provides a REST API that can be used to interact with the platform programmatically. This page describes how to set up the API and use it to access Ganymede resources. 
For details regarding the API endpoints, see the [API Reference](https://docs.ganymede.bio/api).


## Add an API Key

To use the Ganymede API, you need to create an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests. 

Create a secure string outside of Ganymede, such as a password manager, and then add a secret to your Ganymede environment with the key prefix `ganymede_api_key` and a meaningful name (ex: `ganymede_api_key_github_repo`) and the value set to the secure string you created.

## Use the API Key

Supply the API key in the `api-key` header of your HTTP requests. The header should look like this:

```http
api-key: <your_secure_string>
``` 

The provided sample code in the API Reference shows how to use the API key in various programming languages, such as curl, Python, JavaScript, and others.
