<br />

The notifications table provides the following information per event.

- **Type**: Events are categorized as either _SAVE_ or _RUN_.
    - _SAVE_: Created when Flows are saved.
    - _RUN_: Created when Flows are executed.
- **Flow Name**: The name of the Flow that was saved or run. A search bar is provided for filtering specific Flows.
- **Date / Time**: The date and time when the event was created.
- **Status**: The current status of the event, with the following possible values:
    - **Processing**: The event has been initiated and is in progress. For _SAVE_ events, processing will temporarily disable users from running flows, as the entire environment is saved and deployed when a flow is saved. Flow runs will become available again once all SAVE events are no longer in the Processing state.
    - **Completed**: Event completed successfully. 
    - **Flow Error**: Applicable only to _RUN_ events, indicating that a Flow run has failed. Detailed logs can be viewed on the [Flow Runs page](FlowRuns.mdx).
    - **Error**: An unexpected error occurred. Users should retry the operation or contact [Ganymede Support](../Support.mdx) for assistance.
    - **Timeout**: The notification timed out 180 seconds after the event started. Users should check the Flow that triggered the event for the latest status or try the operation again.
- **User**: The login of the user who triggered the associated event.
