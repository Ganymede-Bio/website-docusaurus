## Flows

### [Flow](../flows/FlowEditor)

A sequence of Nodes used to process data. Flows are executed from top to bottom, with edges indicating execution dependencies between Nodes.

When Flows are saved, whether from the [Flow Editor](../flows/FlowEditor) or from a Node specific to a notebook, all code and configuration changes are stored in a git repository, and corresponding updates are made to a cloud-native workflow orchestration platform.

### [Node](../../nodes/Overview.mdx)

The fundamental processing unit in Flows.  Nodes that can be customized contain SQL and/or Python templates that can be customized.  The diagram below shows the execution order for a configurable Node.

A comprehensive listing of different Nodes and their attributes can be found on the [Node Overview page](../../nodes/NodeOverview).

### Node Attribute

Parameters associated with a Node used to configure Node behavior.  These can be found by clicking on the [dark blue header bar of a Node](../flows/NodeEditor).

### Table Head

A preview of a table output from Node.  These can be viewed by clicking on [View button in the Header Bar of the Flow Editor page](../flows/FlowEditor#header-bar) and toggling "Show Tables".

## Agents / Connections

### [Gateway](../agents/Agent.mdx#gateway-architecture)

A single executable installed on a PC that manages one or more Connections and handles communication with Ganymede Cloud. The Gateway model (available in version 5.6.0+) simplifies deployment by allowing you to install one executable per PC and manage Connections through the UI.

### Host

A PC where a Gateway is installed and running. Hosts can run multiple Connections simultaneously.

### [Agent Template](../agents/Agent.mdx) (or Agent)

The code and configuration that defines how a Connection behaves. Agent Templates specify the trigger, processor, and action logic, and can be deployed to any Host as a Connection. Agent Templates are configured and monitored within the Connections section of the Ganymede UI.

### Connection

A running instance of an Agent Template on a Host. For example, you may create a single Agent Template for uploading data from flow cytometers, but each flow cytometer would have its own Connection running on its respective Host.

### Other Agent-related terms

A larger set of Agent-related terms can be found in the [Terminology section of the Agents page](../agents/Agent#terminology).

## Files / Tags

### [Tag](../files/Tags.mdx)

A user-defined label applied to files to facilitate organization and searching. 

### [Tag Type](../files/Tags#configuring-file-tag-types)

Category that a Tag pertains to.  Each Tag is linked to a specific Tag type, which defines the label category. For example, a Ganymede environment might include an `Instrument` Tag type, which an analytical chemistry team uses to label raw chromatograms with an `LC` Tag. 

Tag types are set up through the Manage Tag Types view on the Files page in the Ganymede UI. Once configured, these Tag types can be referenced in user-defined code associated with Agents and Flows or specified in the Agent and Connection configuration pages within the Ganymede UI.
