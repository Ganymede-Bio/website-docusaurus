The diagrams below illustrate various ways to integrate Ganymede into laboratory workflows, providing examples of possible architectures.

These diagrams are intended as starting points to help you understand how Ganymede's components can be configured to support different lab operations, rather than as exhaustive solutions.

## Software-Centric

### Data Capture and Visualization

Ganymede aggregates data from laboratory instruments and analytical databases, enabling the creation of operational dashboards and reports for lab managers and scientists. These tools consolidate diverse data sources to provide comprehensive insights.

</div>

#### Example: Dashboarding QMS Data

Centralizing data from multiple instruments and analytical databases allows for monitoring asset utilization and performing reliability analyses. For instance, Ganymede can interface with PI Server and LIMS to generate dashboards that enhance visibility into lab operations.

### Analytical Database Sync

</div>

Ganymede periodically queries analytical databases to extract experimental results, which are then systematically delivered to ELN/LIMS for contextual presentation to wet lab scientists. Similarly, LIMS data is regularly synced to general databases for broader querying and analysis.

#### Example: Delivering ML Results to LIMS

Synchronizing key data from analytical databases used in machine learning with a LIMS, enabling contextualization of experimental results.

### LIMS Sync

</div>

Ganymede facilitates the synchronization of data between two distinct LIMS platforms. This enables users to leverage the specialized features of each LIMS while accessing data from both systems.

#### Example: Synchronizing Domain-Specific LIMS

Synchronizing data between LIMS systems tailored for biologics and small molecule discovery.

## Instrument-Centric

### Hands-Free Data Capture

</div>

Ganymede automatically captures data from lab instruments and stores it without requiring manual intervention. The system creates a corresponding entity in the ELN/LIMS for each instrument execution and associates the results with this entity. Users annotate the experiment on the instrument, and Ganymede parses and forwards these annotations to the ELN/LIMS.

#### Example: Bioprocessing Data Capture

Passive data capture from a bioreactor and associated cell culture analyzer.

### Sample Data / Experimental Results Capture

</div>

Users register samples and experiment run IDs in the ELN/LIMS. After the instrument run, experimental results and the associated run ID are passed to Ganymede, which retrieves the experimental context. Ganymede then processes the data and delivers the results back to the ELN/LIMS.

#### Example: Plate map association for qPCR

Associating sample data and metadata for a live cell imaging experiment or a qPCR run. A plate map is registered in the ELN/LIMS, and after the run, the map and results are processed by Ganymede and sent back to the ELN/LIMS.

### Orchestrated round-trip

  <img width="700" alt="sample data / experiment results capture" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/ganymede-bio-website/public/general/ReferenceArchitectureBidirectional20240614.png"/>
</div>

Users register samples in the ELN/LIMS, which are then processed into input files for the instrument. Ganymede delivers these files either directly to the instrument or to an associated disk drive. After the experimental run, Ganymede captures, processes, and uploads the experimental data back to the ELN/LIMS.

#### Example: Chromatography sample execution and data capture

For a liquid chromatography run, sample and injection data are delivered to the LC, and results are subsequently captured from the CDS used to process the experimental data. Ganymede then performs tailored peak analysis before delivering the results to the ELN/LIMS.

### Orchestration with Manual Processing

</div>

Ganymede delivers sample data to the instrument, expediting experimental setup. After the experiment, Ganymede captures and tags the data, facilitating subsequent discovery.

Users can select the tagged data for manual processing in a virtualized environment. Once processed, the data is returned to Ganymede, which then delivers it to the ELN/LIMS. This workflow allows for the integration of manual analysis steps within an otherwise automated process.

#### Example: Systematically capturing flow cytometry compensation and gating

In a flow cytometry run requiring manual gating to identify cell populations, Ganymede delivers sample information to the flow cytometer and captures raw data with annotations. Users then process the raw data in a virtualized environment, and the results are subsequently sent back to Ganymede for delivery to the ELN/LIMS.
