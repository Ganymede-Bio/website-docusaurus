### March 7 2024
**Improvements**
- Agent file tags can now be added on the Agent configuration page. Agent file tags are applied to each file an Agent captures and uploads.
- The Flow Run or Agent that brought a file into Ganymede is listed in the Origin column, and now displays the Flow name and Flow Run ID, or the Connection ID. All records in the Usage column (where the file is used in Ganymede) are now limited to downstream usage.
- Users can now navigate from the file browser to Flow Runs and Virtualization sessions where a file was used.
