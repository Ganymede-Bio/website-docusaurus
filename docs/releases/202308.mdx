### August 24 2023
**Features/Updates**
- The new file browser is now available when selecting input files from Ganymede Storage to kick off a Flow.
- Flows can now be run when an assayRun.created or assayRun.updated event is received from Benchling.

**Improvements**
- Ganymede URLs have been updated to reflect parameters selected on pages. These routing improvements mean that a user can navigate back/forward in their browser.
- Saving a Flow that has a container node will now provide updates about the container build and deploy progress. Users will be able to run the Flow once the container has been built and deployed. Progress can be tracked on the Notifications page, where updates have an entity type of “Container”.
- Editor notebooks now have a python formatting cell, which runs Black. Once that cell is run, formatting will be automatically applied to cells that are subsequently run in the notebook.
- Editor notebooks now have a cell that can be run for linting the notebook. Linting will also run automatically when the notebook is saved.

**Bug Fixes**
- The Find and Replace function in editor notebooks is now working as expected.
- Multiple Agent connections can now be set up for Agents that watch for Flow outputs.

### August 17 2023
**Features/Updates**
- A new Agent configuration is now available for loading local files and triggering a Flow.

**Improvements**
- Agent connections can now be deleted, if the connection is not in a Live state. This will remove Agent connections from the Connection page.
- Agent names are now included in notifications.

### August 10 2023
**Bug Fixes**
- Flow saves that have no changes will no longer attempt to deploy.
- Agent logs were updated to display timestamps in the user’s local timezone.
- Boolean values will now render correctly in the Data Explorer.

### August 4 2023
**Improvements**
- The editor notebook testing section now supports test files that are up to 1GB in size.
- Agent downloads are now disabled when the most recent build fails, so that obsolete executables are not downloaded by mistake.
- Minor UI updates were made to the Flow Editor, so that it is easier to view and edit node names.

**Bug Fixes**
- The Roles page will now update when the environment is changed.
- Agents with the “Watch for files locally and upload” configuration can now be edited in the notebook.
- Notifications for Flow Saves will now mark previous notifications as complete when the most recent action finishes.
