### August 4 2023
**Improvements**
- The editor notebook testing section now supports test files that are up to 1GB in size.
- Agent downloads are now disabled when the most recent build fails, so that obsolete executables are not downloaded by mistake.
- Minor UI updates were made to the Flow Editor, so that it is easier to view and edit node names.

**Bug Fixes**
- The Roles page will now update when the environment is changed.
- Agents with the “Watch for files locally and upload” configuration can now be edited in the notebook.
- Notifications for Flow Saves will now mark previous notifications as complete when the most recent action finishes.
