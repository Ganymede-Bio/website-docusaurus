  - Review details about your connection by clicking on a connection card
  - The image for the connection can be customized
  - See the connection logs and configuration
  - If the agent is running version 4.5.0 or higher, you can see the details of the PC where the agent is running 
  - If the agent is running version 4.5.0 or higher, you can set connection-specific file tags to be applied to files ingested by that agent

**Improvements**
- **UI**: Users in the environment list are now sorted in alphabetical order
- **Flows**: The queuing time for tasks to execute has been reduced.

**Bug Fixes**
- **Agents**: An issue where 502 responses were being returned intermittently to agents has been addressed


### July 18 2024

**Features**
- **UI**: [Flow history](../app/flows/FlowEditor#historical-flow-versions) is now viewable from within the Flow Editor
  - All of the changes to a flow's configuration and code are available in the Flow Editor by clicking the History button 
  - Flow Runs have a link to the code they were run with
  - Links to specific changes are shareable with others

**Improvements**
- **Agents**: Agents will now raise a specific error if they are unable to start a flow run, previously this error looked similar to other retries
- **Flows**: The [send_email method](../sdk/SendingAlerts#method-send_email) is now testable in notebooks. No email will be sent while testing, an HTML rendering of the email will be displayed
- **Dashboards**: Agents, connections, and flow errors are now available as data sources to be used in dashboards.

  - File tags are displayed in file chip tooltip

**Improvements**
- **UI**: The flow run table can now be filtered by Status and Run By
- **Nodes**: [Trigger_Python node](../nodes/Analysis/Trigger_Python) triggered flow specification moved to user-defined code, allowing user to define logic for specifying downstream flow to trigger
