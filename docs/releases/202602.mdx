### February 26 2026

**Improvements**
- **Agents**: Better detection of private network environments during Gateway installation, which should reduce the likelihood of installation failures in these environments
- **Agents**: More robust handling of Gateway core version updates

**Gateway Version**: 5.6.17

### February 20 2026

**Improvements**
- **Flows**: Added enforcement of sequential execution for Flows that have their concurrency set to 1
  - This ensures that Flows with this option enabled will run in the order they were triggered, which can be important for certain workflows that require sequential processing
  - This only applies to Flows that have their concurrency set to 1, which means that only one instance of the Flow can run at a time. Flows with higher concurrency settings will not be affected by this change
- **Flows**: Added automated clean up for Flows that fail to start within 72 hours of being triggered
- **Agents**: Improved the deployment process when a Gateway is installed on a network with private certificates
- **Agents**: Improved the robustness of network requests that add Tags to Files
- **Web UI**: Added more filtering against web scanning attempts

- **Files**: Fixed an issue with handling files with special characters in their names, which could cause errors when uploading or downloading files

### February 13 2026
**Features**
- **Web UI**: Added support for creating Tables with partitioned columns via the Web UI

  - A Table can be partitioned on a Datetime column, or auto partitioned based on the row creation date
  - Partition columns can be specified when creating a new Table only

- **API**: Added new API endpoints to create/update/delete Tables via API
