### November 7 2024

**Features**
- **Virtualization**: Virtualization sessions can now be [paused](../app/virt/Virtualization#pausing-a-session) and resumed, with all saved files retained
    - Pausing a session will stop the session from running, retaining the files in the input and output folders
    - Resuming a session will restart the session with files retained

**Improvements**
- **UI**: Code syntax highlighting is now available in the View Code modal for [Flows](../app/flows/FlowEditor#historical-flow-versions) and [Agents](../app/agents/AgentMonitoring#viewing-historical-code)

**Bug Fixes**
- **UI**: Fixed an issue where Agent logs and status updates were not being displayed in real-time
- **UI**: Fixed an issue where queued flow runs would display the incorrect start time
