### April 17 2025

**Improvements** 
- **Agents**: _stream_contents_ has been added as a [reserved variable for File Watcher Agents](../app/agents/Agent#reserved-variables).  Setting the variable to true for a connection streams the contents of the file to the agent, which can be useful for large files that are not easily read in their entirety.
