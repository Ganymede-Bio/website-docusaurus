### June 06 2024

**Improvements**
- **Agent**: The Agent's name is now displayed on Connection cards (previously was the Agent's ID)
- **Flow**: The run ID for a flow can now be retrieved from the [GanymedeContext attribute `flow_run_id` or the corresponding Ganymede object attribute `flow_run_id`](../api/GanymedeClass).
- **Node**: The S3_Read node now has an associated notebook that allows the user to inspect files in the S3 bucket prior to syncing to Ganymede storage.

**Bug Fixes**
- **Agent**: Fixed an issue where setting file tags on an agent was causing errors
- **Agent**: Fixed an issue where agents were marked as disconnected even when they still pinged the API Server
