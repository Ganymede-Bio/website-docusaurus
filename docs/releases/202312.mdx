### December 7 2023
**Features/Updates**
- [Flow Run errors](../FlowView.mdx#error-attribution) can now be attributed to validation, connection, function, or platform errors. These errors can be customized and raised in user-defined code by using the Ganymede Exceptions class in the Ganymede SDK. Errors are displayed with a custom message, function, and line number at the top of the logs drawer.

**Improvements**
- There are now 401 and 404 pages throughout the app, to provide additional visibility of errors.
