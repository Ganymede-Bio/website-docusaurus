**Features**
- **API**: Added a new [streaming data endpoint](../api/stream-data) to allow for real-time data processing. This endpoint will store data in a table that can be queried via the API or from Flows.
- **API**: Added a new endpoint for [modifying file tags](../api/modify-file-tags.api.mdx).

**Improvements**
- **Flows**: A new orchestration engine has been implemented to improve the reliability and performance of Flows. This new engine will be rolled out gradually to all users over the next few weeks and requires no changes to existing Flows. With this new engine, users can expect:

  - Faster Flow startup times 
  - Clearer Flow logging and error messages

- **Modular Analysis**: Added example Modular Analysis applications to documentation
  - [Bioprocess](../app/ma/apps/BioprocessApp.mdx)
