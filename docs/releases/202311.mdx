### November 9 2023
**Improvements**
- All URLs now include the environment name for specificity.
- When a user clicks on a Ganymede link but is not logged in, they will now be redirected to their desired link after login.
- Zip files for bulk downloads are now named with the current datetime.
- PDF parsing node types ([PDF_Read](../nodes/File/PDF_Read.md) and [PDF_Read_Multi](../nodes/File/PDF_Read.md)) are available for use again.
- A [retrieve_tables](../sdk/GanymedeClass.mdx#method-retrieve_tables) method was added to the Ganymede SDK, which retrieves tables, preserving special characters in table names. 


**Bug Fixes**
- In the file browser, changing environments will now clear the current selection.
- Connections no longer appear to be disconnected when there is a mismatch between a lab PC time and UTC.

### November 2 2023
**Features/Updates**
- Flows can now be assigned to specific users so that a curated list of My Flows appears on the [<div className="button darkblue_button"><HomeOutlined /> **Home**</div>](../Home.mdx) page. Admins can assign Flows to users from the Flow settings panel, or users can self-assign Flows from the All Flows tab.
- Users can now select and download multiple files at once from the file browser. The cumulative size of the files selected must be less than 2GB, and files will download as a zip file.
