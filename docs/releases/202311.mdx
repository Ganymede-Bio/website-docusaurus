### November 2 2023
**Features/Updates**
- Flows can now be assigned to specific users so that a curated list of My Flows appears on the home page. Admins can assign Flows to users from the Flow settings panel, or users can self-assign Flows from the All Flows tab.
- Users can now select and download multiple files at once from the file browser. The cumulative size of the files selected must be less than 2GB, and files will download as a zip file.
