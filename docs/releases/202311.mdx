**Improvements**
- All URLs now include the environment name for specificity.
- Zip files for bulk downloads are now named with the current datetime.
- PDF parsing node types (PDF_Read and PDF_Read_Multi) are available for use again.
- A retrieve_tables method was added to the Ganymede SDK, which can retrieve a list of tables from Ganymede Context and set data types if they are known. 

**Bug Fixes**
- In the file browser, changing environments will now clear the current selection.
- Connections no longer appear to be disconnected when there is a mismatch between a lab PC time and UTC.

### November 2 2023
**Features/Updates**
- Flows can now be assigned to specific users so that a curated list of My Flows appears on the [<div className="button darkblue_button"><HomeOutlined /> **Home**</div>](../Home.mdx) page. Admins can assign Flows to users from the Flow settings panel, or users can self-assign Flows from the All Flows tab.
- Users can now select and download multiple files at once from the file browser. The cumulative size of the files selected must be less than 2GB, and files will download as a zip file.
