### June 1 2023
**Features/Updates**
- Users can now configure a Flow to run on a scheduled interval. Intervals can be set with a combination of month, week, day, hour and minute.

**Bug Fixes**
- Clicking a table head in the Flow Editor will now link to that table in the Data Explorer, as it was before.
- When both a directory and a subdirectory had files, and the file watcher was in cumulative mode, the directory-level files were being run in duplicate. This has now been resolved, so that those files are only run once.
