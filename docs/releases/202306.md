### June 8 2023
**Improvements**
- Colors and icons were added to the environment selectors, to make it easier for users to quickly differentiate between environments.

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed a bug where the initial page load was slow in environments that had a large number of recent Flow Runs.
- When changing environments in the Flow Editor, there was an issue where the previously loaded Flow remained visible in the new environment. This has been resolved, and the Flow Editor will only contain Flows from the selected environment.

### June 1 2023
**Features/Updates**
- Users can now configure a Flow to run on a scheduled interval. Intervals can be set with a combination of month, week, day, hour and minute.

**Bug Fixes**
- Clicking a table head in the Flow Editor will now link to that table in the Data Explorer, as it was before.
- When both a directory and a subdirectory had files, and the file watcher was in cumulative mode, the directory-level files were being run in duplicate. This has now been resolved, so that those files are only run once.
