### May 2 2024
**Improvements**
- Util methods were added to the Ganymede SDK for use by Agents that scan for recently modified files. These methods are particularly useful in cases where a single file is being updated continuously by an instrument.
- The Ganymede context for a specific historical Flow Run can now be retrieved by instantiating Ganymede context with a run_id set.
- The Benchling Event operator can now store data and continue running the Flow that it is in.

**Bug Fixes**
- Changing environments with an active file search will now clear the search parameters.
- In the advanced search panel, the tag type dropdown now uses tag type display name instead of tag type id.
