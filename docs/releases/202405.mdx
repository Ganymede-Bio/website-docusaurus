### May 9 2024
**Features/Updates**
- The Home Page now shows a summary of the recent Connection activity and the files that have been recently uploaded to Ganymede
- Searching for files by tag is now simpler with a quick search option in the Files page that lets you search for files by recent tag with a single click

**Improvements**
- Agent notebooks now use the built-in notebook save function instead of using a cell to perform the save operation. Use Cmd+Shift+S / Ctrl+Shift+S as a shortcut similar to editor notebooks
- Users can now quickly add a tag filter by clicking on one in the Recent Tag section of Advanced Search panel 

**Bug Fixes**
- The dropdown for the Benchling Tag node type is now reliably populated

### May 2 2024
**Improvements**
- Util methods were added to the Ganymede SDK for use by Agents that scan for recently modified files. These methods are particularly useful in cases where a single file is being updated continuously by an instrument.
- The Ganymede context for a specific historical Flow Run can now be retrieved by instantiating Ganymede context with a run_id set.
- The Benchling Event operator can now store data and continue running the Flow that it is in.

**Bug Fixes**
- Changing environments with an active file search will now clear the search parameters.
- In the advanced search panel, the tag type dropdown now uses tag type display name instead of tag type id.
