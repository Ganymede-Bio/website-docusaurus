### October 5 2023
**Features/Updates**
- Benchling nodes now include the Benchling class of the Ganymede SDK. This class makes it more straightforward to interface with Benchlingâ€™s API.
- A generic API node was added to the node library.

**Improvements**
- A WSP class was added to the Ganymede SDK for handling flow cytometry workspace files from FlowJo. This class can:
    - Extract cell counts and statistics from gated populations
    - Extract a table structure from the table editor
    - Extract a compensation matrix (or matrices)
    - Capture the structure of gates
    - Apply compensation to event data
- GPT template code was added to the Image_Write node.
- The timeout period of file uploads from Agents was extended, so that large files can be captured by Agents.
- Agent download dropdowns are now disabled while an Agent builds, so that previous versions are not inadvertently downloaded.
