### October 26 2023
**Features/Updates**
- A [Trigger_Python](../nodes/Analysis/Trigger_Python.md) node type is now available - this node type can trigger a downstream Flow.

**Improvements**
- For clarity, Flow saves now have a notification type of “Flow Save” instead of “Flow”.

### October 20 2023
**Features/Updates**
- Agents can now automatically deploy updates to existing Connections. For this functionality to be enabled, the core Agent version must be upgraded to at least v1.0.0 and the Deployment Setting must be set to “auto-deploy”.
- A Branch_Python node type is now available - this node type enables logic that determines whether a Flow should stop or trigger a subset of downstream nodes.

**Improvements**
- The status of each Agent is now displayed on the Connections page, alongside the status of each Connection.
- Deployment Settings and Core Agent Updates are now displayed independently from the Agent configuration.
- Connections will now shut down automatically when the backing Agent is disabled or deleted.
- Agents will now attempt retries when they fail to trigger a Flow Run.
- A method for unregistering and archiving specified custom entities was added to the Benchling Class in Ganymede SDK.

**Bug Fixes**
- The Agent build history is no longer truncated and now displays the full history.

### October 12 2023
**Features/Updates**
- [Allotrope ADM validation schemas](../sdk/markdowns/allotrope_schema.md) are now available in the Ganymede SDK.
- Sending [email notifications](../sdk/SendingAlerts#sending-emails-from-execute-function) from within a Flow is now possible by using the GanymedeEmailAlert class in the Ganymede SDK.

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed a bug that prevented an Agent from queuing a multi-file input to a Flow.

### October 5 2023
**Features/Updates**
- Benchling nodes now include the Benchling class of the Ganymede SDK. This class makes it more straightforward to interface with Benchling’s API.
- A generic API node was added to the node library.

**Improvements**
- A WSP class was added to the Ganymede SDK for handling flow cytometry workspace files from FlowJo. This class can:
    - Extract cell counts and statistics from gated populations
    - Extract a table structure from the table editor
    - Extract a compensation matrix (or matrices)
    - Capture the structure of gates
    - Apply compensation to event data
- GPT template code was added to the Image_Write node.
- The timeout period of file uploads from Agents was extended, so that large files can be captured by Agents.
- Agent download dropdowns are now disabled while an Agent builds, so that previous versions are not inadvertently downloaded.
