### May 1 2025

**Features**
- **UI**: Agents can now detect errors with the Connection identity
  - Agents will now detect errors or configuration issues with the Connection identity and display them in the UI
  - These errors should be resolvable by modifying the Connection identity through the UI
  - Additional error states will be detected in the future

**Improvements** 
- **Agents**: _get_process_metrics_ has been added as a [reserved variable for Agents](../app/agents/Agent#generic-reserved-variables). Setting this variable to false for a connection will skip the collection of host metrics, if the collection of those metrics is not needed.

**Bug Fixes**
- **Agents**: Fixed an issue where expired certs on instrument PCs could prevent Agent from starting, and prevent the Agent from being able to trigger Flows.  Agents v5.5.1 and later will rely on bundled certs to avoid this issue.

**Agent Version**: 5.5.5
