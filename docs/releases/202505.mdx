### May 1 2025

**Features**
- **UI**: Agents can now detect errors with the Connection identity
  - Agents will now detect errors or configuration issues with the Connection identity and display them in the UI
  - These errors should be resolvable by modifying the Connection identity through the UI
  - Additional error states will be detected in the future

**Improvements** 
- **Agents**: _skip_host_metrics_ has been added as a [reserved variable for File Watcher Agents](../app/agents/Agent#reserved-variables). Setting this variable to true for a connection will skip the collection of host metrics, if the collection of those metrics is not needed.

**Agent Version**: 5.5.5
