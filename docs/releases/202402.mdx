### February 29 2024
**Features/Updates**
- Agent icons feature more prominently on Connections page

**Improvements**
- Agent executable files now contain agent name and version
- Benchling class now supports notebook entry creation
- LC class now supports validating AIA file structure (CDF files enabling transport of data between different chromatography data systems)

**Bug Fixes**
- Notebook saves now slightly more performant
- Query latency within orchestration runs modestly improved in environments with many calls


### February 22 2024
**Features/Updates**
- [Python 3.11.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/) is now supported in all Ganymede environments (both notebooks and workflow orchestrator).

**Improvements**
- The Benchling class in Ganymede SDK now supports bulk assay result creation, which can be used to write results directly to an assay result table in a notebook entry.
- The Ganymede SDK now has a retrieve_files_current_run helper method for referencing the files from the current Flow Run.

### February 15 2024
**Features/Updates**
- Flow output files can now be used as inputs to downstream Flows.
- A [Benchling_Warehouse_Query node type](../nodes/App/Benchling_Warehouse_Query.md) was added. This node can query the Benchling warehouse directly from the Ganymede SDK.

**Improvements**
- File tags can now be applied to [files that are in NodeReturn](../connectivity/Tags.mdx). This prevents the need for downstream nodes that tag files.

**Bug Fixes**
- The tooltip on file chips now scrolls to display all files that are part of a group.
- The Flow Runs table now shows a loading state properly.

### February 8 2024
**Improvements**
- Node name is now displayed in the editor notebook browser tab.
- The Benchling class of the Ganymede SDK will now retry unsuccessful entity registrations and assay result creations.

**Bug Fixes**
- Scheduled Flow Runs (cron) occasionally displayed an inaccurate run duration, but has been corrected.

### February 1 2024
**Improvements**
- The Ganymede Storage modal, used for selecting Flow Run inputs, now defaults to only showing valid input files for the selected Flow.
