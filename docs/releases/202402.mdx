### February 22 2024
**Features/Updates**
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) is now supported in all Ganymede environments.

**Improvements**
- The Benchling class in Ganymede SDK now supports bulk assay result creation, which can be used to write results directly to an assay result table in a notebook entry.

### February 15 2024
**Features/Updates**
- Flow output files can now be used as inputs to downstream Flows.
- A [Benchling_Warehouse_Sync node type](../nodes/App/Benchling_Warehouse_Sync.md) was added. This node can query the Benchling warehouse directly from the Ganymede SDK.

**Improvements**
- File tags can now be applied to [files that are in NodeReturn](../connectivity/Tags.mdx). This prevents the need for downstream nodes that tag files.

**Bug Fixes**
- The tooltip on file chips now scrolls to display all files that are part of a group.
- The Flow Runs table now shows a loading state properly.

### February 8 2024
**Improvements**
- Node name is now displayed in the editor notebook browser tab.
- The Benchling class of the Ganymede SDK will now retry unsuccessful entity registrations and assay result creations.

**Bug Fixes**
- Scheduled Flow Runs (cron) occasionally displayed an inaccurate run duration, but has been corrected.

### February 1 2024
**Improvements**
- The Ganymede Storage modal, used for selecting Flow Run inputs, now defaults to only showing valid input files for the selected Flow.
