### November 7 2025

**Improvements**
- **Web UI**: Added a table view of Instrument Types to allow for easier scanning and sorting of Instrument Types
- **Web UI**: When connecting Instrument Types to Instruments, the model is now displayed to help differentiate between similar Instrument Types
- **Node**: Added file_recency_days attribute to S3_Write node to allow users to limit the number of days back to look for files to sync, improving sync performance.

**Bug Fixes**
- **Flow**: Fixed an issue where Table writes in Flows were not being tracked
- **API**: Fixed an issue where API calls to [retrieve Flow code](/api#tag/Commits/getRepositoryCommits) was failing

  To address these issues, users with self-managed Git repositories will need to update their local versions of [flow-commit-action](https://github.com/Ganymede-Bio/flow-commit-action/tree/main) and [flow-pull-action](https://github.com/Ganymede-Bio/flow-pull-action) to latest.
