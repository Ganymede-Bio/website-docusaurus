### November 7 2025

**Improvements**
- **Web UI**: Added a table view of Instrument Types to allow for easier scanning and sorting of Instrument Types
- **Web UI**: When connecting Instrument Types to Instruments, the model is now displayed to help differentiate between similar Instrument Types
- **Node**: Added file_recency_days attribute to S3_Write node to allow users to limit the number of days back to look for files to sync, improving sync performance.

**Bug Fixes**
- **Flow**: Fixed an issue where Table writes in Flows were not being tracked
- **API**: Fixed an issue where API calls to [retrieve Flow code](../api/get-repository-commits.api.mdx) was failing
- **Self-Managed Repos**: Fixed various issues related to self-managed Git repositories:
  - Flow and Node deletions were not synced to local repos
  - Local repo changes were not being detected properly

  To address these issues, users with self-managed Git repositories will need to update their local versions of [flow-commit-action](https://github.com/Ganymede-Bio/flow-commit-action/tree/main) and [flow-pull-action](https://github.com/Ganymede-Bio/flow-pull-action) to latest.

**Documentation**
- **Processes**: Added documentation for setting up [Processes, Unit Operations, and Instruments](../app/processes/Processes.mdx)

**Agent Version**: 5.5.84
