## _class_ GPT

**GPT** allows users to make calls to the OpenAI GPT models as a coding assistant.  This requires configuring an OpenAI API Key for the environment, which can be done on the [Environment Administration](../AdminControls.mdx) page. Some example use cases of this class are shown below.

:::caution

Please ensure your internal corporate policies allow for GPT usage following [OpenAI policies](https://openai.com/policies) such as the [OpenAI data usage policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) prior to enabling and using this feature.

:::

### Initial Configuration
Navigate to the Environment Administration Panel by clicking on the user profile button in the top right corner of the Ganymede UI and selecting "Environment Settings".

&nbsp;

Enter in the secrets shown above, which can be found by signing up for [OpenAI API access](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  

- **openai_api_key**: API Key for OpenAI access; should be a string starting with `sk-`.
- **openai_organization**: API Key for OpenAI access; should be a string starting with `org-`.


### Basic question and answering
Calling GPT with no parameters initializes the API with a default persona.  The _render_ function renders the output from GPT in markdown.  By default, `gpt-3.5-turbo` is used; [model version](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) can be passed as a keyword parameter upon initialization.

```python
from ganymede_sdk.editor import GPT

gpt = GPT()
res = gpt.ask("How do I write a python function to print hello world")
res.render()
```

### Continuing a conversation
A conversation is continued when subsequent questions are asked.  Continuing along the lines of the example above, the following question continues the conversation with context from the earlier dialogue.

```python
res = gpt.ask("What about the same function in French")
res.render()
```

### Clearing conversation history
Conversation history can be cleared by calling the _clear_history_ function.

```python
gpt.clear_history()
```

### Coding assistance
Default coding prompts are available for assistance with common coding-related tasks.

```python
# List available actions
gpt.list_actions()

# For the execute function within a notebook, this call yields 
# step-by-step explanation of code behavior
gpt.ask(execute, action="explain_code")

# Generates a docstring in NumpyDoc format for the execute function
gpt.ask(execute, action="generate_docstring")
```
