# API Documentation Exclusion List
# This file documents which schemas and endpoints are excluded from the build
# to improve build performance. These files contain circular references or
# excessively large generated samples that cause memory issues during build.
#
# Format:
#   - name: The schema/endpoint name
#   - file: The actual filename pattern to exclude
#   - size: The typical file size
#   - reason: Why it's excluded

# Notes:
# - These files total approximately 12MB of the 15MB total documentation size
# - Excluding them reduces build memory usage by ~80%
# - The remaining ~100 files (~3MB) build successfully without issues
# - Users can still access the OpenAPI spec directly for full schema details
