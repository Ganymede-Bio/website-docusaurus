## Agent-triggered flows

Objects for triggering a Flow from an [Agent](../../app/agents/Agent) can be found in `agent_sdk` for Agents v5.0+.

:::note

The `agent_sdk` is only available for Agents v5.0+.  Prior to v5.0, these functions were included in `ganymede_sdk.agent`.

:::


### `class` FileWatcherResult

FileWatcherResult is a dictionary of FileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`.

- _param_ **files**: dict[str, fileParam | list[FileParam]] - Dictionary of FileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`
- _param_ **tags**: list[UnappliedFileTag] | None - List of tags to be applied to all files

### `class` TriggerFlowParams

TriggerFlowParams specifies the inputs for the Flow executed when all files are observed.  It includes the following parameters:

- _param_ **single_file_params**: dict[str, FileParam] | None - Dict of FileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`.  These parameters are used for Nodes that accept a single file as input.
- _param_ **multi_file_params**: dict[str, MultiFileParam] | None - Dict of MultiFileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`.  These parameters are used for Nodes that accept multiple files as input.
- _param_ **benchling_tag**: Tag | None - Additional parameters to be passed to flow.  This parameter is used for inputs to the Input_Benchling node.
- _param_ **additional_params**: dict[str, str] | None - Additional parameters to be passed to flow.  This parameter is used for inputs to the [Input_Param node](../../nodes/Tag/Input_Param.md); the key is the name if the Node name for the input parameter, and the value is the string to pass into the Node.

### `class` FileParam

FileParam specifies files to be uploaded to Ganymede Cloud and their corresponding Flow parameters. These parameters are provided to the _execute_ function once all files are detected.

- _param_ **filename**: str - Name of the file, e.g. "my_file.txt"
- _param_ **content_type**: str - Content type of the file, e.g. "text/plain".  If not specified, the content type of the first file in the files dict will be used.
- _param_ **body**: bytes - File contents in bytes
- _param_ **param**: str - Name of parameter to be used in Flow, e.g. `node_name`.`parameter_field_name`
- _param_ **parent_dir**: str - Path within the Agent watch directory containing the file.  For example. if C:/Users/username/watch_dir/ is being watched and C:/Users/username/watch_dir/abc/def/my_file.txt is found, then parent_dir would be "abc/def"
- _param_ **upload_ts**: str - Timestamp string in ISO format of when file was uploaded to the Agent watch directory, e.g. "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"
- _param_ **upload_path**: str | None - Path in Ganymede storage where file will be uploaded

The MultiFileParam object contains a method for initiation from a list of FileParam objects as shown below.  The content type of the object is assumed to take on the content type of the first item in the list.

```python
# assume fp1 and fp2 are FileParam objects
m = agent_sdk.file_params_list_to_multi([fp1, fp2])
```

### `class` NoOpFileTagParams

NoOpFileTagParams is a used to specify that tags should be applied to a file, but that no Flow should be triggered upon file upload to Ganymede.

- _param_ **files**: list[FileParam | list[FileParam]] - List of FileParam objects to apply tags to

### `function` fp

`fp` returns a function that performs pattern matching against a file path.  Specifically, the function returns callable[[str], bool] - a function that takes a file path and returns True if the file path matches the pattern, and False otherwise.

This function can be useful as a template for creating your own pattern matching functions.

- _param_ **watch_dir**: str - Directory to watch for files
- _param_ **pattern**: str - Glob pattern to match against the file path

- _param_ **bucket_name**: str - Bucket name of file to delete Tag from
- _param_ **storage_provider**: str - Storage provider of file to delete Tag from, either 'gcs' or 's3'

## Checksum functions

Agent utility functions are provided in `agent_sdk` for validating data integrity and interacting with file systems.

### Computing file checksums

Ganymede provides functions to validate file integrity; these values can be used to verify the integrity of a file uploaded to cloud storage

### `function` calculate_crc32c

The function returns the CRC32C checksum of a file as a string encoded in utf-8.

- _param_ **file_path**: str - Path to file to generate checksum for
- _param_ **blocksize**: int | None - Block size to use for the checksum calculation.  If not specified, the default block size is 2**20.

### `function` calculate_md5

The function returns the MD5 hash of a file as a string encoded in utf-8.

- _param_ **file_path**: str - Path to file to generate MD5 hash for

### Examples

```python
# Before Agent v5.0
# from ganymede_sdk.agent.utils import calculate_md5, calculate_crc32c

from agent_sdk import calculate_md5, calculate_crc32c

file_path = "path/to/local/file"

# either md5 or crc32c can be used to validate the integrity of a file
md5 = calculate_md5(file_path)
crc32c = calculate_crc32c(file_path)
```

You can also calculate the checksum of a file uploaded to Ganymede Cloud by creating a a tempfile.TemporaryFile object, writing the file contents to it, and then calculating the checksum:

```python
from agent_sdk import calculate_md5, calculate_crc32c
import os
import tempfile

data = b"Example data to calculate checksum"

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp_file:
    tmp_file.write(data)
    tmp_file_name = tmp_file.name

md5 = calculate_md5(tmp_file_name)
crc32c = calculate_crc32c(tmp_file_name)

os.remove(tmp_file_name)
```

## File system utilities

`agent_sdk` provides a number of convenience functions, which can be helpful to use with cron Agents that involve more complex logic prior to invoking a flow.  Some examples of this are when a file is written to multiple times before being processed, or if there is a variable number of files being processed, such that the trigger for invoking a flow requires more than just the presence of a file.

### `class` ScanResult

ScanResult is a frozen dataclass stores file paths for files of interest.  Two files are considered to be the same if they have the same relative_path amd modified_time.

- _param_ **relative_path**: str - Path to file
- _param_ **modified_time**: datetime - Datetime of when file was last modified

### `function` list_files_recursive

`list_files_recursive` returns a list of all filepaths in a directory and its subdirectories as a list[str].

The Flow could query previously uploaded files using the [list_files_recursive](#function-list_files_recursive) method to avoid uploading the same file multiple times.

## Accessing Ganymede Cloud 

### `function` read_sql_query

`read_sql_query` returns a pandas DataFrame object containing the results of a SQL query run against the Ganymede DB.

- _param_ **sql_query**: str - SQL query to run

`get_secret` returns the value of a secret stored in Ganymede.

- _param_ **secret_name**: str - Name of the secret to retrieve

## Logging Methods

Ganymede Agents (v5.0+) support user-defined logging messages in the `agent_sdk`, aligning with [logging level for Agent messages](../../app/agents/AgentLogs#logging-level).  Each level corresponds with a separate method in agent_sdk.

### `function` internal

`internal` logs a message at the internal level.

### `function` debug

`debug` logs a message at the debug level.

### `function` info

`info` logs a message at the info level.

### `function` activity

`activity` logs a message at the activity level.

### `function` error

`error` logs a message at the error level.

```python
from agent_sdk import internal, debug, info, activity, error

# log internal
internal('Display internal message')

# log debug
debug('Display debug message')

# log info
info('Display info message')

# log activity
activity('Display activity message')

# log error
error('Display error message')
```

In the UI, these log messages are [viewable and filterable on the corresponding Connections page](../../app/agents/AgentMonitoring#viewing-logs).

## Notifications

Ganymede Agents (v5.1.31+) support sending email notifications to users via the `agent_sdk`.  Email addresses for notifications can be set in the Agent Connection configuration as shown below:
