Objects associated with triggering a flow from an [Agent](../../../connectivity/Agent) can be found in `ganymede_sdk.agent.models`.  

Within the user-defined function for Agents that execute flows, the get_param_mapping function is run whenever a file is added or modified
in the directory that the Agent is watching, and the execute function is run whenever all files are observed.  The _get_param_mapping_ function
is used to specify the parameters that will be passed to the flow, and the _execute_ function is used to specify the input files and parameters to
the flow that is executed.

A skeleton for the user-defined function with associated types is shown below:

```python
def fp(watch_dir: str, parent_dir: str, pattern: str) -> Callable[[str], bool]:
    pass

def get_param_mapping(
    watch_dir: str,
    parent_dir: str = "",
    file_name: str = "",
    modified_time: str = "",
    body: bytes = bytes(),
) -> Dict[str, Callable[[str], bool]]:
    # returns a dictionary of fp objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`
    pass

def execute(flow_params_fw: FileWatcherResult) -> TriggerFlowParams:
    # returns a TriggerFlowParams object
    pass
```

## Classes associated with triggering a flow from an Agent

The FileWatcherResult consists of a dictionary of FileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`.
- _param_ **files**: Dict[str, fileParam] - Dictionary of FileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`
- _param_ **tags**: Optional[List[FileTag]] - List of tags to be applied to all files

TriggerFlowParams is used to specify the inputs to the flow that is executed when all files are observed.  It contains the following parameters:
- _param_ **single_file_params**: Optional[Dict[str, FileParam]] - Dict of FileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`.  These parameters are used for nodes that accept a single file as input.
- _param_ **multi_file_params**: Optional[Dict[str, MultiFileParam]] - Dict of MultiFileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`.  These parameters are used for nodes that accept multiple files as input.
- _param_ **benchling_tag**: Optional[Tag] - Additional parameters to be passed to flow.  This parameter is used for inputs to the Input_Benchling node.
- _param_ **additional_params**: Optional[Dict[str, str]] - Additional parameters to be passed to flow.  This parameter is used for inputs to the Input_Param node.

The FileParam and MultiFileParam objects are used to specify the files to be uploaded to Ganymede Cloud and the corresponding flow parameters to be used in the flow.  A dictionary of FileParam objects (FileWatcherResult) are provided to the `execute` function once all files to observe are detected.

The FileParam object contains the following parameters:
- _param_ **filename**: str - Name of file, e.g. "my_file.txt"
- _param_ **content_type**: str - Content type of file, e.g. "text/plain".  If not specified, the content type of the first file in the files dict will be used.
- _param_ **body**: bytes - File contents in bytes
- _param_ **param**: str - Name of parameter to be used in flow, e.g. `node_name`.`parameter_field_name`
- _param_ **parent_dir**: str - Path within Agent watch directory that contains file.  For example. if C:/Users/username/watch_dir/ is being watched and C:/Users/username/watch_dir/abc/def/my_file.txt is found, then parent_dir would be "abc/def"
- _param_ **upload_ts**: str - Timestamp string in ISO format of when file was uploaded to Agent watch directory, e.g. "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"
- _param_ **upload_path**: Optional[str] - Path in Ganymede storage where file will be uploaded
- _param_ **tags*: Optional[List[FileTag]] - List of tags to be applied to file
- _param_ **bucket_name**: str - Bucket associated with file
- _param_ **files**: str - Alternative method for specifying file contents.  If specified, then the key of this dict is used as thefilename and the value is used as the body.

The MultiFileParam object is used for submitting multiple files to a single node.  It contains the following parameters:
- _param_ **files**: str - Alternative method for specifying file contents.  If specified, then the key of this dict is used as thefilename and the value is used as the body.
- _param_ **content_type**: str - Content type of file, e.g. "text/plain".  If not specified, the content type of the first file in the files dict will be used.
- _param_ **param**: str - Name of parameter to be used in flow, e.g. `node_name`.`parameter_field_name`
- _param_ **parent_dir**: str - Path within Agent watch directory that contains file.  For example. if C:/Users/username/watch_dir/ is being watched and C:/Users/username/watch_dir/abc/def/my_file.txt is found, then parent_dir would be "abc/def"
- _param_ **upload_ts**: str - Timestamp string in ISO format of when file was uploaded to Agent watch directory, e.g. "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"
- _param_ **upload_paths**: Optional[List[str]] - Path in Ganymede storage where file will be uploaded
- _param_ **tags*: Optional[List[FileTag]] - List of tags to be applied to file
- _param_ **bucket_name**: str - Bucket associated with file

The MultiFileParam object contains a method for initiation from a list of FileParam objects as shown below.  The content type of the object is assumed to take on the content type of the first item in the list.

```python
# assume fp1 and fp2 are FileParam objects
m = MultiFileParam.from_file_param([fp1, fp2])
```

The TriggerFlowParams object is used to specify the inputs to the flow that is executed when all files are observed.  It contains the following parameters:
- _param_ **single_file_params**: Optional[Dict[str, FileParam]] - Dict of FileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`.  These parameters are used for nodes that accept a single file as input.
- _param_ **multi_file_params**: Optional[Dict[str, MultiFileParam]] - Dict of MultiFileParam objects indexed by `node name`.`param name`.  These parameters are used for nodes that accept multiple files as input.
- _param_ **benchling_tag**: Optional[Tag] - Additional parameters to be passed to flow.  This parameter is used for inputs to the Input_Benchling node.
- _param_ **additional_params**: Optional[Dict[str, str]] - Additional parameters to be passed to flow.  This parameter is used for inputs to the Input_Param node.
