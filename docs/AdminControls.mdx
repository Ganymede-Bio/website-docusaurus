## Summary

The Admin page enables administrators to manage user access and configure environment secrets. This page can be accessed by clicking on the bubble containing your email address in the top right corner of the top navbar and selecting Environment Settings.

### Access Levels

The Roles panel shown below enables adminstrators to specify access levels for different users:

There are five levels of access, and are set at the environment level.  These access levels are shown below in order from least to most restrictive. Roles that are higher in the list contain all the access of roles beneath them.  For example, users with Writer privilege have all the privileges of a Runner in addition to the ability to create _flows_.

**Admin**:
    Manage the environment settings, able to manage access of others. Admins are able to create, modify, and execute _flows_.

**Writer**:
    Can create, modify, and execute _flows_.

**Runner**:
    Can execute _flows_, but cannot modify or create new _flows_.

**Reader**:
    Can observe _flows_, read data, and observe environment settings, but not permitted to execute or alter _flows_.

**None**:
    Cannot see the environment as an option in the dropdown menu.  This is relevant for providing access to a specific environment; for example, a user may have **Runner** permission for prod but **None** permission for dev if that user is not involved in development.

### Environment Secrets

The secrets panel enables administrators to configure secrets.  These secrets are specific to the nodes used within a given environment (i.e. - development or production environment).
The example shown in the image below shows an environment with a AWS S3 Role ARN specified, enabling connectivity between Ganymede cloud and AWS S3 Storage when using the [S3_Read](./nodes/App/S3_Read) or [S3_Write](./nodes/App/S3_Write) nodes.

Admins can add secrets by clicking on the Add Secret button and edit secrets as appropriate.  Note that secrets cannot be viewed from this panel, so if a secret is lost, it can either be re-entered here or recovered by [contacting Ganymede support](mailto:support@ganymede.bio).
