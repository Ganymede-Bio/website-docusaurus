This page describes a set of common issues associated with configuring agents.

#### Issue: I am unable to install the agent on Windows; the installer is failing at the final step.

Ensure that you are running the installer as an administrator.  

Then, ensure that there is not an existing installation that is conflicting with the current installation.  To do so, open up the Task Manager and navigate to the Services tab.  Look for any service that starts with "GanymedeAgent-" and stop the service by right clicking on it and selecting "Stop".  Open up "Add or Remove Programs" and uninstall any existing Ganymede Agent installations.  Then, try installing the Agent again.

#### Issue: The Agent is not actively running.  How do I check?

On Windows, check that the installed agent is running by opening up Task Manager and navigating to the Services tab.  Look for the agent of interest (will be a service with a name starting with "GanymedeAgent-") and verify that its current status is Running.  

On Linux, check that the installed agent is running by opening up a terminal and running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status GanymedeAgent-<agent_name>
```

If you do not see it, ensure that the Agent is installed.

If you see that the Agent is present but is not running, right click on the service and select "Start".  This should start the Agent.  Note that, by default, Agents are configured to start upon reboot.

#### Issue: Agent is showing as disconnected after the Agent has been running for a while

On Windows, ensure that the PC that the Agent is installed on is not asleep.  In particular, PCs with cron Agents should be configured to never sleep.  To do so, open up the Control Panel and navigate to "Hardware and Sound" -> "Power Options".  Select "Change when the computer sleeps" and set "Put the computer to sleep" to "Never".

Also, ensure that the current system time is properly sync'd; if the time is not inaccurate, the Agent will show as disconnected.  To do so, right click on the time in the bottom right corner of the screen and select "Adjust date/time".  Ensure that the "Set time automatically" option is enabled, and click "Sync now".

#### Issue: The flow is failing to trigger when files are being dropped

Look at the logs for the agent in Ganymede App.  If you see the JWT error below, click on the system clock in the lower right corner of the screen and select "Adjust date/time".  Ensure that the "Set time automatically" option is enabled, and click "Sync now".

```shell
_thread.ExceptHookArgs(exc_type=<class 'google.auth.exceptions.RefreshError'>, exc_value=RefreshError('invalid_grant: Invalid JWT: Token must be a short-lived token (60 minutes) and in a reasonable timeframe. Check your iat and exp values in the JWT claim.', {'error': 'invalid_grant', 'error_description': 'Invalid JWT: Token must be a short-lived token (60 minutes) and in a reasonable timeframe. Check your iat and exp values in the JWT claim.'})
```

If not, verify that the watch folder is specified correctly.  This is configured upon [Agent installation](./Agent#windows-installation); note that the input path must be specified with forward slashes for both Windows and Linux installations.

For example, to watch a folder on the Desktop named "watch_folder" specify the following on installation, with \<username\> replaced with the appropriate user name:

```bash
-v "input_path=C:/Users/<username>/Desktop/watch_folder"
```

:::note Take care when copying and pasting commands
One common gotcha is that the quote character `"` somehow gets replaced with the left or right quotes (`“` or `”`) when copying and pasting commands from documents (which can be hard to spot).  Always ensure that the single quote character `"` is used.

#### Issue: All files are present in the directory watched.  In the logs within the app, files are shown as being collected in two different waiting groups, so the flow does not trigger.  How do I ensure that all files appear in the same waiting group?

A: Unquote the string referenced within the fp function, which specifies which filename patterns the Agent should watch for.  An example is shown below:

```python
def fp(watch_dir: str, parent_dir: str, pattern: str) -> Callable[[str], bool]:
    def fp_res(x: str):
        x = parse.unquote(x)
        return x in glob.glob(os.path.join(watch_dir, pattern), recursive=True)

    return fp_res
```
