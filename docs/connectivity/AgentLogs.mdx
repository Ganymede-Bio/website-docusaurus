## Agent State Diagrams

The diagrams in this section show the steps that an Agent transitions through during installation, startup, and execution.  This can be useful for flagging or debugging issues related to Agent operation.

### Installation

Upon installing the binary associated with an Agent, the Connection associated with the Agent looks for whether a connection file exists to determine configuration.  If not available, configuration information is collected in a wizard (graphical for Windows, CLI for Linux) and a Connection configuration file is stored to a local file based on these inputs.

If the binary associated with the Agent is re-run, the Agent will attempt to use the previous configuration (found in the same directory as the binary) if available.  This can be convenient if there is a need re-install an Agent; to avoid using the existing connection configuration, remove the existing configuration file.

### Startup

At startup, Connections follow the steps shown below; these steps are executed by the service that is created immediately after an Agent binary has been run.

- **Create OS signal handling**: Signal handlers specific to the OS are created for handling system events (for example, to halt execution)
- **Load conn obj from yaml**: Load the configuration file created during installation to the Connection
- **Validate configuration**: The Agent validates that the configuration file is valid
- **Upload local and OS service logs**: Local logs are for the Agent Connection are uploaded.  Note: this log upload occurs on a best efforts basis prior to health checks conducted in the subsequent step, and so may fail if the computer lacks connectivity with Ganymede Cloud
- **Health Check**: Connectivity to Ganymede cloud and ability for the Agent to access local watch directory is established
- **Register Connection**: Connection registers its configuration with Ganymede Cloud, sets its runtime state to EXECUTING, and its connection state to LIVE
- **Start Status Ping**: Status ping thread starts executing.  This thread also handles version updates and responds to Ganymede Cloud requests to shut down (e.g. - if a user disables the Agent in the Ganymede web app)
- **Execute Pipeline**: Connection executes its stated purpose (e.g. - scans local directory for new/modified files and uploads them)

### Execution

Connections associated with an Agent pass through runtime states shown below.  Transitions between the different states can be found in Connection log messages.

| EXECUTING                | Agent has registered Connection, and shared that the state of the Connection is LIVE.                                                              |
| RUNTIME_UPDATE           | Processor from Agent is being updated. The processor is the code that executes the user-defined code.                                              |
| FULL_UPDATE              | A full update of the Connection is being performed; the prior Agent executable is being uninstalled and a new Agent executable is being installed. |
| SHUTDOWN_STARTED         | Connection shutdown started (Connection has shared that it's state is SHUTDOWN with API server)                                                    |
| SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE        | Connection shutdown is complete                                                                                                                    |

| SHUTDOWN         | Connection stopped and shut down. Will require manual intervention to restart. |

## Logging

The table below shows log messsages that can be found in Agents / Connections.  These can be found in the UI by navigating to the relevant Connection.

* **Message**: message received from Agent
* **Description**: contextualized version of message emitted by Agent
* **Section**: section within Agent code generating message
* **Logging Level**: level of severity that log indicates
* **OS**: operating system that the message pertains to, if applicable
* **Associated Error Type**: associated Agent error type, if applicable

### System-generated messages

The messages below are logged on method calls within the Connection, and can be used to trace through the thread stack and call stack.
