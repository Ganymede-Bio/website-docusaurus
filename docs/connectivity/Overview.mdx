## Overview

Connectivity is fundamental to ensuring that lab data is systematically captured, forming the foundation of the Ganymede platform. Ganymede offers four primary methods for capturing instrument files and data:

- [Manually drag-and-dropping files](../FlowView.mdx) into the Ganymede app, where they are processed via flows
- Using a [Ganymede Agent](./Agent.mdx), a Linux or Windows-based executable that captures instrument files for storage and processing, or automatically captures files generated by instrument PCs in cloud storage
- Leveraging [event-driven processing](#event-driven-processing) to listen for and process files written to an S3 bucket or other event sources
- Utilizing a [Browser-based File Watcher](./BrowserFileWatcher.mdx) to capture and associate files with specific flows

## Drag-and-drop

Instrument files can be drag-and-dropped into file inputs associated with a specific flow.  This method requires no setup and is available immediately after your Ganymede tenant is configured.

### When to use Drag-and-drop

Drag-and-drop is ideal when manual input is common, and there are relatively few instrument files to process. This method is the simplest to set up but requires more manual effort to use. Once files are captured, previously processed files can be easily accessed within Ganymede, eliminating the need to re-upload the same files.

Users can specify input parameters during flow execution, allowing for greater flexibility in flows that require varying execution based on user input.

However, the drag-and-drop method may become cumbersome for instruments that generate large volumes of files.

## Ganymede Agent

The Ganymede Agent is an installable program that captures, transfers, and processes files, either locally or online. Agents are configured within the Ganymede app and can be downloaded to Windows and Linux instrument PCs. Once installed, Agents run as a background service, resilient to computer restarts.

### When to use Ganymede Agent

Ganymede Agents provide a robust solution for capturing files without user intervention. Running in the background on the instrument PC, they are durable against restarts and unintended shutdowns.

Agents also enable developers to write custom code that executes on the instrument PC, offering greater flexibility in how files are captured and processed.

### When Ganymede Agents are not appropriate

Agents require the installation of software on an instrument PC, which may not be suitable if there are concerns about loading third-party software on the system. Additionally, because the Agent does not require a login to capture files, it cannot distinguish between different users if a shared login is used on the computer unless this information is specified in the contents of captured files.

## Event-Driven Processing

Ganymede can be configured to listen for and trigger Flows based on AWS and Benchling events. This method requires credentialing Ganymede to capture relevant events.

### When to use Event-Driven Processing

The use cases for event-driven processing depend on the system emitting the events.

AWS events are particularly useful when many files are generated from a lab instrument and methods already exist to write these files to AWS S3 in an organized manner.

## Browser-based File Watcher

Input nodes in a Flow can be configured to monitor specific directories on the instrument PC, allowing the Ganymede web app to view the local file system. Like drag-and-drop, this method requires no additional setup beyond enabling the Ganymede app.

### When to use Browser-based File Watcher

This approach automates data capture without user input, requires no installation of executables on the local machine, and does not need cloud infrastructure configuration to start.

However, the file watcher will stop running when the Ganymede browser tab is closed. This can happen unintentionally if the instrument PC is shut down or restarted for updates. As such, Ganymede Agents are generally more robust than the browser-based file watcher.

### When not to use Browser-based File Watcher

Since the file watcher passively collects files without requiring user login, this method would not capture user identity (unless present in the contents of the underlying files captured).
