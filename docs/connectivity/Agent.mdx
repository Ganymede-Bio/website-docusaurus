Ganymede Connections are a class of programs that can run directly on an instrument computer in the lab. Each Connection consists of a combination of user-defined code and Ganymede configuration, allowing for maximum flexibility in capturing files and interacting with the Ganymede ecosystem. 

# Terminology
- Agent: A combination of a trigger, processor, and action configuration to move data from a remote user device into Ganymede.
- Trigger: A component that is configured to kick off the remaining agent pipeline based on a particular change or event
- Processor: User defined code that converts whatever data is produced from a trigger into data that can be handled by the action in the end form appropriate for the use case.
- Action: An interaction with Ganymede's cloud or application that will move data output from the processor into the configured location.
- Connection: A running instance of the agent that has previously or is currently connected to Ganymede, waiting for the configured trigger.
- Pipeline: A data flow of trigger -> processor -> action. This is tailored to the use case and is composed of a processor template to help guide that use case. Two pipelines can be composed of the same trigger and action but because of the end usage be populated with a different processor template on creation that is suited toward a given use case.
- Runtime Uptime: An update to the latest processor and configuration (agent and connection-levels) that occurs “in-place”. Without requiring any stop or start of the process. The pipeline loop temporarily pauses to reload the files but no data is lost.
- Full Update: A complete update of the connection binary. This is useful for including new dependency updates or core-codebase changes. A new connection executable must be brought up in parallel.
- Connection Configuration: Each installed executable maintains its own name, labels, variables, and file tags. These, plus the “parent-level” agent configuration and processor make a connection unique. Certain connection metadata is not configurable and therefore not a part of the configuration, such as the id, start time, version, and generated metadata. 
- Connection Version: Anytime the connection configuration is modified, the connection version is updated. This version should follow the standard Ganymede version scheme of YYYYMMDD_HHmmSSssss
- Agent Configuration: An agent’s action and trigger can be configured for certain behavior. Otherwise, the configuration includes other user-friendly optiosn such as name and file tags. 
- Agent Version: Any time the agent configuration is changed, the version, in the standard Ganymede version scheme, is updated. 
- Core Version: This refers to the underlying core agent repo version. This is the internal foundational code that all agents, regardless of type or configuration, run on. New features and bug patches for the core will increment the version. 
- Connection Variables: Key-Value pairs that are stored in the connection configuration, meaning that they can be different per executable, that are allowed to be accessed by the user. These variables may be valuable for processor code that depends on certain connection-level variables.
- Connection Labels: A list of strings that are intended to help categorize and identify connections in the Ganymede UI. 
- Connection Context: An internal dictionary to the code that should not be exposed to the user but allows passing data between the agent trigger, processor, and action if necessary.

# Quick Start
After creating a Connection, users can build and install local executables called Agents, individual instances of a given Connection, on instrument PCs.

<img
  alt="Connections front page"
  src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/GanymedeConnectionsFrontPage_20240521.png"
/>
&nbsp;

Agents can

- filter and designate how to process data
- upload files into Ganymede Cloud
- initiate data processing pipelines, which can be based
  - upon specific files being written to the local machine by the instrument
  - upon specific files being written to a cloud storage bucket
  - on a scheduled cadence
- deliver data to instrument PCs from Ganymede Cloud

Users specify which of the above actions to take by configuring the Agent in the Ganymede app. Doing so creates a Linux binary and Windows executable corresponding to the specified configuration, which users can then install on instrument PCs. Once created, users can optionally [configure a user-defined Python script](#configuring-user-defined-python) associated with the Agent.

For details on system requirements for Agents, see [Agent Network Config & Prerequisites](../configuration/AgentNetworkConfig).

## Building an Agent Overview

To create a new Agent, click the <div className="button system_button"><PlusOutlined /> New Agent</div> button on the Agents tab of the Connections page.

<img
  alt="New Agent creation"
  src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Connections_Front_Page20231108.png"
/>
&nbsp;

The left side of the configuration panel is used to specify the Agent's configuration; Agent parameters relevant to selected configuration are displayed. The right side of the configuration panel shows the default Python script associated with the Agent, which can be modified after Agent installation.

<div class="text--center">
  <img
    alt="New Agent configuration"
    src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/New_Agent_Configuration2_20240331.png"
  />
</div>
&nbsp;

After filling out this form, click <div className="button darkblue_button_icon">Create</div> to start building Windows and Linux executables. When the build is complete, the Agent (i.e. - the configured executables) can be downloaded from the Ganymede application by selecting the corresponding Agent from the Connections tab.

Building an executable typically takes around 10 minutes to complete. Once built, the Agent can be downloaded onto the instrument PC from the Connections tab of the Ganymede web app and installed.

## Configuring Agents

All Agents have two required input parameters, _Name_ and _Configuration_. Once the Configuration is selected, Input Parameters specific to the Configuration may appear.

The _Name_ input is used to specify the display name for the Agent.

The _Configuration_ input specifies the action performed by the Agent, chosen from the following options:

- [**Watch for files locally then run flow**](#watch-for-files-locally-then-run-flow): Monitor specified directory on the local file system for files to process and execute upon observing new files matching specified pattern
- [**Set a cron job to run flows periodically**](#set-a-cron-job-to-run-flows-periodically): Periodically observe local directory for files and deliver those files to Ganymede Cloud for processing
- [**Watch for files locally and upload**](#watch-for-files-locally-and-upload): Monitor specified directory on the local file system and upload files to Ganymede Cloud upon observation.
- [**Watch for flow outputs then save locally**](#watch-for-flow-outputs-then-save-locally): Monitor specified flow in Ganymede Cloud Storage for new output files, and capture + process files on local instrument PC upon observation.

:::note

For Cloud Watcher agents that download files from Ganymede Cloud, you can specify that they watch for flow _inputs_ (instead of the flow outputs) by adding the following to the Additional Params input box:

```bash
-v "input_bucket=true" 
```
:::


- [**Load local files into Ganymede with a custom filter**](#load-local-files-into-ganymede-with-a-custom-filter): Send specified files on local instrument PC and process on Ganymede Cloud
- [**Set a cron job to upload files periodically**](#set-a-cron-job-to-upload-files-periodically): Periodically deliver files to Ganymede Cloud

Three additional input parameters are available for all configurations:

## Configuration Options

### Watch for files locally then run flow

#### Input Parameters

- `Flow Name`: Flow to run upon observing new files matching specified pattern
- `Check Period (seconds)`: Frequency with which Agent will poll local directory for new files
- `If a discovered filename exists in storage`: Whether to use the file in storage or the observed file in the local directory
- `File pattern to parameter mapping`: For the selected Flow, the [glob pattern](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) to associate with the input parameter(s)
  - This option is only available on create. Further configuration updates will occur inside the notebook, not inside the agent configuration
- `File Tags`: Tags to associate with the files uploaded to Ganymede Cloud
- `Image`: Image to associate with agent.  A common use case is to associate an image of the instrument that the agent is running on.
- `Auto deploy code and configuration changes to Live Connections`: If checked, updates to agent code will be reflected on currently installed agents.

The corresponding user-defined code will be generated to map those file patterns to parameters.  There are 2 functions that could require modification in the user-defined code during configuration:

- `get_param_mapping`: This function is called whenever a file is added or modified in the watch directory.  Modify this function to specify the files you want to look for prior to triggering a flow.
- `execute`: Called when all glob patterns specified by `get_param_mapping` have been matched, this object returned by this function specifies the inputs to the flow that is executed when all files are observed.
- `fp`: This function returns a function that performs pattern matching against a file path.  Use this function as a template for matching files.

For example, if the instrument outputs a CSV file called "\{id\}\_lc_output\<YYYYMMDD\>.csv" which is to be ingested by a [CSV_Read node](../nodes/File/CSV_Read.md) called "Ingest_Data", an appropriate configuration would be "\{id\}\_lc_output\*.csv" for the input box associated with the "Ingest_Data.csv" node.  The corresponding user-defined code would be:

```python
from ganymede_sdk.agent.models import TriggerFlowParams, FileWatcherResult
import re
from typing import Dict, Callable
import glob
import os


def fp(watch_dir: str, parent_dir: str, pattern: str) -> Callable[[str], bool]:
    """
    This function returns a function that performs pattern matching against a file path.
    Use this function as a template for creating your own pattern matching functions, which
    you can then use in the values of the return object in the get_param_mapping function.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable[[str], bool]
        Function that takes a file as input and returns True if the file matches the pattern.
    """

    def fp_res(x: str):
        return x in glob.glob(os.path.join(watch_dir, pattern), recursive=True)

    return fp_res


def get_param_mapping(
    watch_dir: str,
    parent_dir: str = "",
    file_name: str = "",
    modified_time: str = "",
    body: bytes = bytes(),
) -> Dict[str, Callable[[str], bool]]:
    """
    This function is called when a file is added or modified in the watch directory.
    Modify this function to capture the files you want to trigger the flow;
    the function should return a dictionary where the keys are <node name>.<param name>
    and values are functions for performing pattern matching against the target file.

    For nodes that accept multiple inputs, specify a list of functions to match against;
    each specified function should uniquely match 1 file.
    """
    id_group = re.search(r"^(\w+)", file_name)
    if id_group == None:
        return {}
    id = id_group.group()
    return {
        "Ingest_Data.csv": fp(watch_dir, parent_dir, f"{id}_lc_output*.csv"),
    }


def execute(flow_params_fw: FileWatcherResult) -> TriggerFlowParams:
    """
    Called when all glob patterns specified by get_param_mapping have been matched.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flow_params_fw : FileWatcherResult
        Dict of FileParam objects indexed by <node name>.<param name>
    """
    return TriggerFlowParams(
        single_file_params=flow_params_fw.files,
        multi_file_params=None,
        benchling_tag=None,
        additional_params={},
    )
```

If a second parameter is added, such as an [Excel_Read node](../nodes/File/Excel_Read.md) called "Experiment_Context" that accepted files of the pattern "\{experiment_id\}\_context.xlsx", then the get_param_mapping function would later have to be modified to include that param like so:

```python
def get_param_mapping(
    watch_dir: str,
    parent_dir: str = "",
    file_name: str = "",
    modified_time: str = "",
    body: bytes = bytes(),
) -> Dict[str, Callable[[str], bool]]:
    """
    This function is called when a file is added or modified in the watch directory.
    Modify this function to capture the files you want to trigger the flow;
    the function should return a dictionary where the keys are <node name>.<param name>
    and values are functions for performing pattern matching against the target file.

    For nodes that accept multiple inputs, specify a list of functions to match against;
    each specified function should uniquely match 1 file.
    """
    id_group = re.search(r"^(\w+)", file_name)
    if id_group == None:
        return {}
    id = id_group.group()
    return {
        # The keys in the dict below take the form "<node name>.<parameter name>"
        # For example, the default Input_File node is called "Input_File"
        # and has a parameter called "file_pattern", so the key would be
        # "Input_File.file_pattern"
        "Ingest_Data.csv": fp(watch_dir, parent_dir, f"{id}_lc_output*.csv"),
        "Experiment_Context.excel": fp(watch_dir, parent_dir, f"{id}_context.xlsx"),
    }
```

This would not only ensure the files that match the parameters are sent to the correct flow node, but also only group files of the same id together. If three files came were ingested in the following order:

- experiment626_lc_output072623.csv
- experiment627_context.xlsx
- experiment626_context.xlsx

Instead of starting the flow after the first two files, which do fulfill the parameter file patterns, the experiment ids will be grouped together so that the flow is only started when all experiment626 files are ready.

Whenever a file matches a glob pattern, it will be uploaded to Ganymede storage, even if it's not used in a flow. Files that are written to the watched directory can be ignored by ensuring that they do not match any of the glob patterns for the parameter inputs.

    width="500"
  />
</div>
&nbsp;

Patterns can also be matched against subdirectories using `*` for single level subdirectories and `**` for any level subdirectories.

For example, if your instrument writes out files in a directory like:

```bash
├── experiment_id_1
│   ├── configuration.xml
│   └── results.csv
└── experiment_id_2
    ├── configuration.xml
    └── results.csv
```

You would use parameters like `*/configuration.xml` and `*/results.csv` to upload the files and submit them to a flow.

Documentation on the objects used in the user-defined code for these agents can be found on the [Agent Data Models](../sdk/markdowns/AgentModelsAndMethods.mdx) page.

## Installing Agents

To install an Agent, open the Ganymede application in a browser window and navigate to the Connection tab in the left sidebar. Select the desired Agent by name and download the relevant Windows/Linux installation file.

:::note

Both Linux and Windows versions of the Agent are built using x86_64 architecture. The Linux executable is Ubuntu-based and the Windows executable is Windows Server 2022.

:::

### Windows Installation

After downloading the Agent, launch the installation file to complete Agent configuration

<div class="text--center">
  <img
    alt="Windows Agent installation"
    src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Windows_Setup20230605.png"
    width="500"
  />
</div>
&nbsp;

- **Connection name** is the name seen by users in the instrument computer and in the Ganymede UI
- **Variable definitions** are strings in the format "var_name=var_value", which allows users to set context variables to be used in the user-defined Python
- **Label** is a string that can be used to identify and group connections within Ganymede. The label is visible in the Connections UI

Variables and labels can be referenced in your user-defined code by extracting the values from `kwargs`:

```python
labels: list[str] = kwargs.get('labels', [])
# -- OR --
vars: dict[str, str] = kwargs.get('vars', [])
```

For Agents that reference local directories, the directory watched is specified in the Additional Params input box:

```bash
-v "input_path=/absolute/path"

# Example Windows input path specification
# -v "input_path=C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\watch_folder"

# If the directory is in a network drive, be sure to use the UNC path or IP like so:
-v "input_path=//server/share/path"
# where `server` is the name of the server and `share` is the name of the shared folder
```

:::info Sleep status

Agents may be unable to run if the computer enters a sleep state; this is particularly relevant for cron flows. To prevent this, ensure that the computer is not set to sleep when the flow is expected to execute.

:::

:::note Network privileges

Because Windows services use the Local System User, which does not have network privileges by default, you may need to ensure the service is running on a user which can access the network drive.

To do so, follow the steps below:

1. **Set Up Authentication**:
   - There are two options for authenticating to a remote system:
     - Use Windows Credential Manager to store the remote user's credentials on the local system.
     - Create matching local (if cross-domain) or domain (if on the same domain, e.g. AD) user accounts on both the remote and local systems.
2. **Check Network**:
   - Ensure both systems can communicate using tools like `ping`.
3. **Service Configuration**:
   - Open `services.msc` on the local system.
   - Find and right-click the Ganymede service > `Properties` > `Log On`. Use the local user account where the credentials are stored (not the "Local System Account").
4. **Restart Service**:
   - In `Services`, right-click the service and select `Restart`.

**Note**: Use IP if systems are on different domains.

:::

### Linux Installation

After downloading the agent, modify permissions for the binary to 755.

```bash
chmod 755 agent_name_<timestamp>_agent
```

Create a [systemd service file](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html) similar to what is shown below:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Ganymede Example Agent
After=network.target
Wants=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
TimeoutSec=30
User=jane_doe
ExecStart=/path/to/agent/executable -n GanymedeExampleAgentService -v "input_path=/path/to/watch/dir"
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/ganymede/GanymedeExampleAgentService.log
StandardError=append:/var/log/ganymede/GanymedeExampleAgentService_err.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- **Description**: field to identify the Agent in logs
- **After** and **Wants**: ensures that basic networking has been set up before launching the agent
- **StartLimitIntervalSec**: set to 0 to avoid service from stopping; by default, the service would stop after a certain number of failures within a specific timeframe
- **Restart**: set to restart the Agent on unclean exit code or abnormal exit; does not restart on clean exit.
- **User**: user to associate Agent runs with.  To see the current user, run `whoami`.
- **ExecStart**: path to the Agent executable.  The executable takes the following command-line arguments:
  - -n / --name: Required field for the name of the connection used to identify the device and its data, logs, and status throughout Ganymede.
  - -v / --var: a string in the format "var_name=var_value" that allows setting user context variables accessible from user-defined agent code.  Multiple variables can be specified as shown in the [append configuration setting in argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#action).  This is the argument used to specify the folder to watch; if not specified, the folder watched will be the directory containing the agent binary.
- **StandardOutput**: log file for Agent output.
- **StandardError**: log file for Agent errors.  
- **WantedBy**: specifies that, if the service has been enabled, the service should be started when multi-user.target is reached during the boot process.  This occurs when the system is operational and ready for multiple users to log in and use the system in a non-graphical mode.

Once the service file is created, the Agent can be started by copying the file to /etc/systemd/system/ and setting permissions of the service file to 644. For example, if the systemd service file were named _ganymede_example_agent.service_, this could be accomplished by running:

```bash
sudo cp /path/to/ganymede_example_agent.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/ganymede_example_agent.service
```

To launch this service, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# to start the Agent service
sudo systemctl start ganymede_example_agent.service

# to ensure that the Agent service starts on system startup
sudo systemctl enable ganymede_example_agent.service
```

Some other commands that can be useful:

```bash
# to observe status of the Agent service
sudo systemctl status ganymede_example_agent.service

# to reload the systemd service file after changes have been made to a service file
# and restart the Agent service after changes have been made
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ganymede_example_agent.service
```

:::info
After an agent binary is executed, a connection.yaml file is generated, similar to what is shown below.  When this file is present in the same directory as the agent binary, the agent will use this configuration file to determine inputs.

```bash
environment: ganymede-dev-multi
id: <agent uuid>
inferredData:
  installPath: /path/to/agent/binary
  macAddress: <mac address of machine>
  machineIP: <IP address of machine>
  machineName: <name of machine>
  serviceDisplayName: GanymedeAgent-<agent uuid>
labels: []
name: ganymede_example_agent
startTime: '2024-07-17T15:10:00Z'
tagParams: []
variables:
  input_path: /path/to/watch/dir/
version: <YYYYMMDD-timestamp>
```
:::

## Configuring User-Defined Python

To modify user-defined code executed by the Agent, select the Agent in the Ganymede app and then click on the <div className="button gray_button"><SelectOutlined />Code</div> button. Doing so opens a notebook for the user to modify user-defined code, which is executed on observed files prior to transfer.

<div class="text--center">

</div>

### Monitoring Agent Connections

Agents are capable of communicating with Ganymede Cloud to upload files and run flows. These communications can be monitored by observing status updates and logs in the Ganymede web app UI.

<div class="text--center">
  <img
    alt="Connection cards"
    src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/ConnectionCards20240726.png"
    width="600"
  />
</div>
&nbsp;

Connection data can be viewed by clicking on the connection card in the Connections tab. 


<div class="text--center">
  <img

  />
</div>
&nbsp;

The detail fields of a connection are as follows:

| Field Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|

#### Connection Status

Agents send a heartbeat message to Ganymede Cloud every 30 seconds to inform their status. The status of an Agent can be one of the following:

- **Live**: The Agent is currently running and communicating with Ganymede Cloud
- **Disconnected**: Ganymede Cloud has not received a status update from the Agent in the last 65 seconds
- **Shutdown**: The Agent was intentionally shut down; some potential reasons are if a user shut down the computer, manually stopped the Agent service, or if a known exception occurred for the Agent.
- **Deprecated**: The Agent has been disabled in Ganymede UI as described in the [Updating Agents](#updating-agents) section.

#### Logging

You create custom logs that will be displayed in the Ganymede UI and local log files by using the `logger` keyword argument in your user-defined processor code. For example:

```python
def execute(**kwargs) -> Optional[TriggerFlowParams]:  # type: ignore
    # if there is not logger, the default logger is print
    logger = kwargs.get("logger", print)
    logger(f"Local files: {os.listdir('./')}")
```

### Updating Agents

To modify Agent settings after creation, select the desired Agent in the Connections tab to update the Agent. Upon clicking <div className="button blue_button">Update</div>, the Agent will be built and then made available for download.

<div class="text--center">

    width="500"
  />
</div>
&nbsp;

Agents can also be archived or disabled. 

Archived Agents cannot be updated, but the Agent's connections can still communicate with Ganymede Cloud.  All associated connections for these Agents will continue to run, but the Agent can no longer be modified.  Archived agents can be restored to an active state by selecting the desired Agent and clicking on the <u>Restore Agent</u> link.

Disabled Agents cannot be updated and its connections can no longer communicate with Ganymede Cloud.

### Updating Connections

To update a connection, select the desired connection in the Connections tab to update the connection.  You can update the following fields on a connection from the Ganymede UI:

- Name: Display name for the connection
- Image: Image to associate with the connection
- Tags: [File tags](./Tags) to apply to files uploaded by the connection
- Variables: Key-value pairs that can be referenced in user-defined code
- Labels: Strings that can be used to group connections in the Ganymede UI

### Remote Update of Live Connections
Every time the connection contacts Ganymede with a health check-in, Ganymede responds with any changes the connection needs to incorporate. There are three level of changes that can occur.

- Core Version Update: The core version corresponds to the underlying agent code developed by Ganymede. These changes are new features or patches that can be applied to all agents across all environment but each agent manages which core version it is pinned to.
- Agent Configuration Update: Agent configuration is updated through the agent page or the agent's processor notebook. This is a configuration that all connections for that agent adhere to. For example, if an agent that watcher for files then runs a flow is updated to run a new flow when the params are met, all compatible connections will begin to run that flow after they complete their update. Every save to an agent notebook is considered a new version that will be retrieved and loaded after the connections next status ping.
- Connection Configuration Update: Updates made to the connection's configuration on its page will only update the running connection that it corresponds to. Other connections for that agent will not observe any change is made. This includes connection aspects such as variables and labels.

There are two types of remote updates that occur based on the type of update - full or runtime update.

#### Full Update
**Compatibility**
- Agents _installed_ with core v4.8.0 or later
- The core version of the installed connection must align with the major version of the core version of the agent Ganymede’s UI. Otherwise there is a breaking change that requires reinstallation.
- Auto-update is enabled for the agent

**Cause**
A full update is only triggered for a "Core Version Update." The remote update is not kicked off without user intervention. In the Ganymede UI, an agent's core version is listed on the right side of the page in a section called "Core Agent Infrastructure." If the agent is not up to date to the latest available core version, an "Upgrade" button will appear. The text will inform users what version is available and what version the agent is currently pinned to. 

<div class="text--center">
  <img
    alt="Agent build history"
    src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/AgentUpgrade.png"
    width="800"
  />
</div>

Once a user clicks to Upgrade an agent, all connections will be told of the new version on their next status ping. 

**Update Process**
A full update requires reinstalling the executable, but Ganymede now takes care of this installation seamlessly. When a connection receives a command to do a full update, it will continue to operate normally but also attempt to start the new version in parallel after verifying the validity of the command and the executable. Once this new version registers with Ganymede as operational, the old connection will stop. The new executable will also cleanup the artifacts of the old executable and its dependencies.

If the new connection fails to start, the old connection will resume and will not be told to attempt a full update again on that version to avoid the connection from entering a precarious state.

#### Runtime Update
**Compatibility**
- Agents _installed_ with core v1.0.0 or later
- The core version of the installed connection must match the core version of the agent Ganymede’s UI
- Auto-update is enabled for the agent

**Cause**
Changes in the agent configuration, including the agent processor, or connection configuration will be sent to the connection on its next status ping as soon as they are saved.

**Update Process**
A runtime update does not require any process restart or executable installation. As a result, the connection is able to accept changes to configuration while continuing its normal operations. The update is validated for authenticity, the information is stored locally for access if it connection restarts for any reason in the future, then the information is loaded into the connection's memory for usage in its intended functionality.

### Viewing Build History

Each iteration of Agent build can be viewed in the History tab of the Agent. This view provides context for each change, either in the form of a log of the configuration change or through a custom commit message from the Agent notebook.

<div class="text--center">

</div>

### Uninstalling Agents

#### Windows

The Agent can be uninstalled and associated service removed through the “Add or Remove Programs” panel from the Control Panel.

<div class="text--center">
  <img
    alt="Agent uninstall"
    src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Uninstall20230615.png"
    width="500"
  />
</div>

After uninstalling the Agent, the Ganymede folder will remain in the Program Files directory. This folder can be deleted if desired.

#### Linux

To uninstall the Agent, stop the systemd service associated with the Agent and remove the service file from /etc/systemd/system/
