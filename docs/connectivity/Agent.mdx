Ganymede Agents are a class of programs that can run directly on an instrument PC in the lab. They are a combination of user-defined code and configuration, which allows for maximum flexibility in capturing files.  Agents can

- filter and designate how to process data
- upload files into Ganymede Cloud
- initiate data processing pipelines, which can be based
  - upon specific files being written to the local machine by the instrument
  - upon specific files being written to a cloud storage bucket
  - on a scheduled cadence

Users specify which of the above actions to take by configuring the Agent in the Ganymede app.  Doing so creates a Linux binary and Windows executable corresponding to the specified configuration, which users can then install on instrument PCs.  Once created, users can optionally [configure a user-defined Python script](#configuring-user-defined-python) associated with the Agent.

## Building an Agent Overview

To create a new Agent, click the <div className="button system_button"><PlusOutlined /> New Agent</div> button on the upper-left corner of the Connections page.

<img alt="Agent Front page" src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Connections_Front_Page20230626.png" />
&nbsp;

The left side of the configuration panel is used to specify the Agent's configuration; Agent parameters relevant to selected configuration are displayed.  The right side of the configuration panel shows the default Python script associated with the Agent, which can be modified after Agent installation.

<div class="text--center">

  />
</div>
&nbsp;

After filling out this form, click <div className="button darkblue_button_icon">Create</div> to start building Windows and Linux executables.  When the build is complete, the Agent (i.e. - the configured executables) can be downloaded from the Ganymede application by selecting the corresponding Agent from the Connections tab.  

Building an executable typically takes around 10 minutes to complete.  Once built, the Agent can be downloaded onto the instrument PC from the Connections tab of the Ganymede web app and installed.

## Configuring Agents

All Agents have two required input parameters, _Name_ and _Configuration_.  

The _Name_ input is used to specify the display name for the Agent.  

The _Configuration_ input specifies the action performed by the Agent, chosen from the following options:

- [**Watch for files locally then run flow**](#watch-for-files-locally-then-run-flow): Monitor specified directory on the local file system for files to process and execute upon observing new files matching specified pattern
- [**Set a cron job to run flows periodically**](#set-a-cron-job-to-run-flows-periodically): Periodically observe local directory for files and deliver those files to Ganymede Cloud for processing
- [**Watch for files locally and upload**](#watch-for-files-locally-and-upload): Monitor specified directory on the local file system and upload files to Ganymede Cloud upon observation.
- [**Watch for flow outputs then save locally**](#watch-for-flow-outputs-then-save-locally): Monitor specified directory in Ganymede Cloud Storage for new files, and capture + process files on local instrument PC upon observation
- [**Load local files into Ganymede with a custom filter**](#load-local-files-into-ganymede-with-a-custom-filter): Send specified files on local instrument PC and process on Ganymede Cloud

## Configuration Options

### Watch for files locally then run flow

#### Input Parameters

- `Flow Name`: Flow to run upon observing new files matching specified pattern
- `Check Period (seconds)`: Frequency with which Agent will poll local directory for new files
- `If a discovered filename exists in storage`: Whether to use the file in storage or the observed file in the local directory
- `File pattern to parameter mapping`: For the selected Flow, the [glob pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) to associate with the input parameter(s).
  
For example, if the instrument outputs a CSV file called "lc_output<YYYYMMDD\>.csv" which is to be ingested by a [CSV_Read node](../nodes/File/CSV_Read.md) called "Ingest_Data", an appropriate configuration would be "lc_output*.csv" for the input box associated with the "Ingest_Data.csv" node.

## Installing Agents

To install an Agent, open the Ganymede application in a browser window and navigate to the Connection tab in the left sidebar.  Select the desired Agent by name and download the relevant Windows/Linux installation file.

:::note

Both Linux and Windows versions of the Agent are built using x86_64 architecture.  The Linux executable is Ubuntu-based and the Windows executable is Windows Server 2022.

:::

### Windows Installation

After downloading the Agent, launch the installation file to complete Agent configuration

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Windows Agent installation"
      src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Windows_Setup20230605.png"
      width="500" />
</div>
&nbsp;

- **Connection name** is the name seen by users in the instrument computer and in the Ganymede UI
- **Variable definitions** are strings in the format "var_name=var_value", which allows users to set context variables to be used in the Normalizer
- **Label** is a string that can be used to identify and group connections within Ganymede.  The label is visible in the Connections UI

For Agents that reference local directories, the directory watched is specified in the Additional Params input box:

```shell
# note that forward slashes must be used to specify path, for both Windows and Linux Agents
-v "input_path=/absolute/path"
```

## Configuring user-defined Python

To modify user-defined code executed by the Agent, select the Agent in the Ganymede app and then click on the <div className="button gray_button"><SelectOutlined />Code</div> button.  Doing so opens a notebook for the user to modify the Normalizer, which is executed after the Trigger and before the Action.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Agent update configuration"
      src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Update_Zoomed_In20230605.png"

      width="800" />
</div>
&nbsp;

Previously built agents remain available for download in Ganymede.

## Maintaining Agents

### Viewing Logs

Logs can be found on the Logs tab for each Agent.  These logs contain status check-ins and information regarding the Agent's trigger.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Agent logs"
      src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Logs_Page20230615.png" 
      width="500"
      />
</div>


### Monitoring Agent Connections

Agents with Action types of Upload File and Run Flow communicate with Ganymede Cloud to upload files and run flows, respectively.  These communications can be monitored by observing status updates and logs in the Ganymede web app UI.

The Connections page shows an overview of all connections that have ever been made and their latest status in addition to other metadata made available from their last status ping.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Agent Status"
      src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Status20230605.png"
      width="400" />
</div>
&nbsp;

The Agent page displays a list of all connections instantiated from a specific Agent. This provides the user quick and easy access to the running executables associated with a specific Agent configuration.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Agent Connection Status"
      src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Connection_Status20230605.png"
      width="400" />
</div>
&nbsp;

### Updating Agents

To modify Agent settings after creation, select the desired Agent in the Connections tab to update the Agent.  Upon clicking <div className="button blue_button">Update</div>, the Agent will be built and then made available for download.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Agent update configuration"
      src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Update20230605.png"
      width="500" />
</div>
&nbsp;

Agents can also be archived or disabled.  Archived Agents cannot be updated, but can still communicate with Ganymede Cloud.  Disabled agents cannot be updated or communicate with Ganymede Cloud.

:::note

Listener and Action types cannot be updated once an Agent's configuration is set.

:::

### Viewing Build History

Each iteration of Agent build can be viewed in the History tab of the agent. This view provides context for each change, either in the form of a log of the configuration change or through a custom commit message from the Agent notebook.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Agent build history"
       src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Build_History20230605.png" 
       width="800"
  />
</div>
&nbsp;

Configuration differences between two agent builds can be viewed for audit or debugging purposes by clicking <div className="keystroke blue_keystroke"><DiffOutlined /></div> button.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Agent build history detail"
      src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Build_History_Detail20230605.png" 
      width="800"
      />
</div>

### Uninstalling Agents

#### Windows

The Agent can be uninstalled and associated service removed through the “Add or Remove Programs” panel from the Control Panel.

<div class="text--center">
  <img alt="Agent uninstall"
      src="https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/agent/Agent_Uninstall20230615.png" 
      width="500"
      />
