The Ganymede Agent is an executable that can be installed on lab instruments running Windows or Linux to capture instrument data systematically.  The agent can

- filter and designate how to process data
- interact with connected instruments
- upload files into Ganymede Cloud
- initiate data processing pipelines

By installing Agents, your lab machines become an integrated part of the Ganymede system, enhancing the data management and processing capabilities in your lab.

## Agent Glossary

- **Agent**: A combination of a trigger, processor, and action configuration to move data from a remote user device into Ganymede. It can be helpful to think of an Agent as a class which is instantiated for each new connection. 
- **Agent Connection**: A running instance of the agent on a unique machine that has previously or is currently connected to Ganymede. The instance is listening for the configured trigger and will perform the action defined by the Agent configuration.
- **Trigger**: A configured listener to kick off the remaining agent pipeline based on a particular change or event
- **Processor**: User defined code that converts whatever data is produced from a trigger into data that can be handled by the action in the end form appropriate for the use case.
- **Action**: An interaction with Ganymede's cloud or application that will move data output from the processor into the configured location.
- **Pipeline**: A data flow of trigger -> processor -> action
