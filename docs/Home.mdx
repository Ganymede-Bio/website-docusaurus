The My Flows tab contains flows relevant to the user, and can be assigned by selecting the appropriate _flow_ from the [<div className="button darkblue_button"><BranchesOutlined /> **Flow Editor**</div>](./FlowEditor.mdx) page.  

## NavBars

### Collapsible Sidebar

### Environment Selector

This dropdown decides which environment that is currently being looked at. All tables, flows, and dashboards that are shown are associated with this environment. They can be color coded and have icons to distinguish them a bit easier.
