Functions are used within _Flows_ to perform data extraction, transformation, and loading into other apps.

Functions consist of two parts:

- The platform part which is not editable by the user which performs tasks like loading files, authenticating with apps and infrastructure
- The user-editable part which contains some logic and processing which you can edit

The editable parts of functions consist of two languages:
- SQL
- Python (using pandas dataframes)
