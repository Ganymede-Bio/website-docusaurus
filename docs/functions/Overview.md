- Interactions with the platform: tasks like loading files, authenticating with apps and infrastructure, these are not user-editoalbe
- User-editable portions which contains logic and processing which you can edit

The editable parts of functions consist of two languages:
- SQL (using ANSI SQL)
- Python (using Python3 and [pandas dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html))
