## Overview

This page describes how to configure SSO (Single Sign-On) and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for Ganymede, depending on your SAML provider. 

### Okta

Follow [these instructions](https://help.okta.com/oag/en-us/Content/Topics/Access-Gateway/add-app-saml-pass-thru-add-okta.htm) in Oktaâ€™s documentation to create a new Okta SAML application.

The following fields should be used in your application:
| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Single sign on URL | https://ganymede-core.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler |
| Audience URI | ganymede.bio |

Hide this SAML application tile from users - there are instructions below that explain how to create an Okta tile of Ganymede.

Once complete, the following information from your Okta application should be provided to Ganymede: 

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Public Certificate | Must start with "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----", and end with "-----END CERTIFICATE-----". |
| Identity Provider Issuer (Entity ID) | https://www.okta.com/{unique_key} |
| Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL (SSO URL) | https://\{org\}.okta.com/app/\{org\}_ganymede_1/\{unique_key\}/sso/saml |

On the right-side panel of the Okta application window, there is a link to SAML setup. The fields above can be found in that window, and should be shared with Ganymede.

#### Create Bookmark App

There is a known issue between Okta and Firebase, where the Okta tile will not redirect properly to the Ganymede site. After the SAML application above is configured and working properly, [create a new Okta bookmark application](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Apps/apps-create-bookmark.htm) that links to your Ganymede tenant.  

The png below can be used as the image for the Ganymede tile:
