Webhooks are commonly used for robust communication between software systems.

1. From [Ganymede Support](../Support.mdx), obtain the following information:

- The API endpoint to deliver events to: https://your_subdomain.ganymede.bio/event/ENV_NAME/webhook
- Auth header in include in delivered events: SECRET_NAME: SECRET_VALUE

ENV_NAME is your Ganymede environment; for example, if you have development and production Ganymede environments, then webhooks would be configured separately for each of these environments.
SECRET_NAME is a designated name for the secret associated with the webhook
SECRET_VALUE is a random API key

2. Verify that the SECRET_NAME: SECRET_VALUE key-value pair is present in the [Environment Administration panel](../AdminControls.mdx).
