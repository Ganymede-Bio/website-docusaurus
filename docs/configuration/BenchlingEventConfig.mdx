Ganymede Flows can be triggered upon receiving a Benchling event, such as upon entity registration or workflow task creation.  Any event that is sent by Benchling can be used to trigger a Flow; a full listing of events can be found on [Benchling Events Reference](https://docs.benchling.com/docs/events-reference).

1. In your Benchling tenant, open the Settings menu and click Feature settings -> Developer Console ([see Benchling instructions](https://docs.benchling.com/docs/events-getting-started)) to set up delivery of Benchling Events to AWS EventBridge.

2. Populate the following information in Benchling to create an EventBridge subscription with Ganymede:

```shell
AWS account ID: 710795444417
Region: us-east-1
Event bus name: \<Ganymede subdomain\>
Event types: \<event types to listen to\>
```

For example, if your Ganymede tenant was configured as xyz.ganymede.bio and you wanted to execute flows upon entity registration, the configuration would be:

```shell
AWS account ID: 710795444417
Region: us-east-1
Event bus name: xyz
Event types: v2.entity.registered
```

3. Notify [Ganymede Support](../Support.mdx) to complete the configuration of your tenant for handling Benchling Events.
