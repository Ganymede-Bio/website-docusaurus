The <div className="button darkblue_button"><FolderOutlined /> **Files**</div> page provides access to all of the files uploaded to Ganymede and all files created in Ganymede by Flow Runs for the current environment.  Files can be browsed and searched for using various metadata fields, including file name, file type, file size, tags, creation date, file origin and Flows that the file was used in.
