The <div className="button darkblue_button"><FolderOutlined /> **Files**</div> page allows users to search, filter, download, and link to files within the Ganymede environment.

## Finding files

To locate a file by name, enter your query in the search box in the upper left corner of the page. For more advanced filtering, click the filter icon ( <FilterFilled /> ) next to the column headers to apply filters based on specific file properties. After selecting your desired filters, click OK.

### Advanced Search

The advanced search panel allows you to filter files by various file characteristics or [File Tags](./connectivity/Tags).  To use this feature, define tag types on the [Manage Tag Types panel](./connectivity/Tags#configuring-file-tag-types), and assign tags to specific files using methods found in the [file_tags module](./sdk/FileTags) of the Ganymede SDK.

Searches combine conditions across fields with an AND logic, while conditions within the same field use OR logic. For example, searching for files with the "LC" and "MS" instrument tags will return files tagged with either "LC" or "MS" (or both). Adding a size filter of "greater than 1MB" will further narrow the results to files with the "LC" or "MS" tags that are also larger than 1MB.

## Downloading files

To download a file, click the file's name in the _File name_ column.

## Linking to files

To copy a link to a file, click the link icon ( <LinkOutlined /> ) next to a file's name in the _File name_ column.  This link can be shared with other users in the same Ganymede environment.  Visiting the link will open the <div className="button darkblue_button"><FolderOutlined /> **Files**</div> page filtered to show only the linked file.

### Deep Links - URLs for Accessing Ganymede Files from Other Apps

You can generate URLs for files using the [get_file_url function](./sdk/FileTags#get_file_url) in the Ganymede SDK. This function returns a URL that users can use to directly access the file from another application, such as another LIMS system.

```python
from ganymede_sdk.storage import get_file_url

bucket = 'input' # or 'output'
filename = 'sample_file_name.txt'
file_url = get_file_url(filename=filename, bucket=bucket)
```

:::note

Accessing a Ganymede file URL requires the user to be authenticated in Ganymede.  If you're having trouble accessing a file URL, log in to your
Ganymede tenant in a separate Google Chrome browser tab and try again.

## Viewing related entities

For each file, the <div className="button darkblue_button"><FolderOutlined /> **Files**</div> page displays the ID of the Flow or Agent that originated the file (_Origin_) along with the IDs of all Flows and Flow Runs that the file was used in (_Usage_), as applicable.  Click any Flow ID, Agent ID or Flow Run ID to view details for that entity in the <div className="button darkblue_button"><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/flows_icon.svg')} className="filter-white" /> **Flow View**</div>, <div className="button darkblue_button"><ApiOutlined /> **Connections**</div>, and <div className="button darkblue_button"><CheckCircleOutlined /> **Flow Runs**</div> pages, respectively.

## Refreshing

The _Last refreshed_ timestamp in the lower-left corner of the page indicates when the file browser last retrieved an up-to-date list of files from Ganymede storage. To check for newly added files, click the <div className="button darkblue_inverted_button"><SyncOutlined /> Refresh</div> button.
