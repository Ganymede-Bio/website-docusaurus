The <div className="button darkblue_button"><FolderOutlined /> **Files**</div> page provides access to all of the files uploaded to Ganymede and all files created in Ganymede by Flow Runs for the current environment.  Files can be browsed and searched for using various metadata fields, including file name, file type, file size, tags, creation date, file origin and Flows that the file was used in.

## Finding files

To search for a file by name, type a query in the search box in the upper left of the page.  To filter files by other properties, click the filter icon ( <FilterFilled /> ) next to supported column titles in the table header, select the desired values, and click OK.

### Advanced Search

The advanced search panel allows you to filter files by [file tags](./connectivity/Tags).  To use this feature, define tag types on the [Manage Tag Types panel](./connectivity/Tags#configuring-file-tag-types), and assign tags to specific files using methods found in the [file_tags module](./api/FileTags) of the Ganymede SDK.

## Downloading files

To download a file, click the file's name in the _File name_ column.

## Linking to files

Click the link icon ( <LinkOutlined /> ) next to a file's name in the _File name_ column to copy a link to that file to the clipboard.  This link can be shared with other users in the same Ganymede environment.  Visiting the link will open the <div className="button darkblue_button"><FolderOutlined /> **Files**</div> page filtered to show only the linked file.

### URLs for accessing Ganymede files from other apps (deep links)

URLs for files can be generated using the get_file_url function in the Ganymede SDK by calling the `get_file_url` function.

```python
from ganymede_sdk.storage import get_file_url

bucket = 'input' # or 'output'
filename = 'sample_file_name.txt'
file_url = get_file_url(filename=filename, bucket=bucket)
```

This function returns a URL that users can use to directly access the file from another application, such as another LIMS system.  

:::note
Accessing a Ganymede file URL requires the user to be authenticated in Ganymede.  If you're having trouble accessing a file URL, log in to your
Ganymede tenant in a separate browser tab and try again.

## Viewing related entities

For each file, the <div className="button darkblue_button"><FolderOutlined /> **Files**</div> page shows the ID of the Flow or Agent that originated the file (_Origin_) along with the IDs of all Flows and Flow Runs that the file was used in (_Usage_), as applicable.  Click any Flow ID, Agent ID or Flow Run ID to view details for that entity in the <div className="button darkblue_button"><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/flows_icon.svg')} className="filter-white" /> **Flow View**</div>, <div className="button darkblue_button"><ApiOutlined /> **Connections**</div>, and <div className="button darkblue_button"><CheckCircleOutlined /> **Flow Runs**</div> pages, respectively.

## Refreshing

The "Last refreshed" timestamp in the lower left of the page shows the last time the file browser retrieved an up-to-date list of files from Ganymede storage.  Click the <div className="button darkblue_inverted_button"><SyncOutlined /> Refresh</div> button in the lower left of the page to check for files that have been added since the last retrieval.
