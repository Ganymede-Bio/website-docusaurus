Input files can be found under the Uploaded Files section.   _Flow_ outputs can be found in the Results section of the Files page.

To view other flows that have run the same file, click the "Details" button next to a file and a modal will open with that information. 
To navigate to a particular run in the [Flow Runs page](FlowRuns.mdx), click on the Flow Run Id.
