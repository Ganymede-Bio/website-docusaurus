### Observing Flow Status

The run status table displayed consists of the following columns:

- **Input File**: Input files and input parameters associated with Flow run.
- **Output File**: Output files (if applicable).
- **Run By**: Login associated with the user who ran the flow.
- **Start Time**: Timestamp of when the Flow was initiated.
- **Run Duration**: The execution time of the flow in HH:MM format.
- **Status**: The current status of the flow run instance. Possible status values include:
  - **Running**: Job is in the process of running.
  - **Success**: All Nodes have run successfully.
  - **Failed**: At least one Node has failed to run successfully.
- **Logs**: Opens a modal with logs for each Node.

### Observing Node Status

Expanding the status box shows a list of nodes with corresponding run statuses indicated by color.  Some common color codes are:
  - ![#B22222](https://placehold.co/2x2/B22222/B22222.png) **Red**: failure after retries exhausted
  - ![#01FF70](https://placehold.co/2x2/01FF70/01FF70.png) **Light green**: currently running
  - ![#2ECC40](https://placehold.co/2x2/2ECC40/2ECC40.png) **Dark green**: successful run
  - ![#A9A9A9](https://placehold.co/2x2/A9A9A9/A9A9A9.png) **Gray**: queued; awaiting system resource to commence
  - ![#FFFF00](https://placehold.co/2x2/FFFF00/FFFF00.png) **Yellow**: failure to run on at least 1 try; awaiting retry
  - ![#9932CC](https://placehold.co/2x2/9932CC/9932CC.png) **Dark Orchid**: skipped prior to completion; this color may indicate a system resource limitation
  - ![#FFA500](https://placehold.co/2x2/FFA500/FFA500.png) **Orange**: dependency for node has failed, preventing this node from being run

### Determining what code ran

Flow runs include a link to a Flow Version, indicating which version of the Flow was executed for the given run.
