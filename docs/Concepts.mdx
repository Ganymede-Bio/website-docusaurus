![Ganymede example flow](https://ganymede-bio.mo.cloudinary.net/apiServer/FlowImageExpanded_20230531.png)

Developers author **flows**, which are functions comprised of user-editable **nodes**.

- **Flow**: a set of nodes that processes data; the diagram above shows a flow named _ganymede_documentation_.  Flows are executed top-to-bottom, with edges describing execution dependencies between different nodes.  
- [**Node**](./nodes/Overview.md): core unit of processing in Ganymede which performs I/O between different systems and the user-defined components of a node.  The diagram above contains four nodes: Read_CSV, LIMS_Read, Associate_Data, Excel_Write.
- **Node Attribute**: parameters passed into a node.  The Read_CSV node above has two node attributes: `csv` and `results`.
- **Table Head**: a preview of a table output from the node; in the flow above, example_results is the table head for the Read_CSV node.

Each node consists of an Operator and, if customizable, user-defined SQL and/or user-defined Python to enable customization as shown in the conceptual diagram below:

</div>

Depending on the node, data may be retrieved from or sent to 
  - a SQL database
  - cloud storage 
  - third-party API 
  - flat files

When flows are saved, whether from the flow editor or from a node specific to a notebook, associated code changes are stored in a git repository and deployed to a cloud-native workflow orchestration platform for executing code.
