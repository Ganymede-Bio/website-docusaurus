Developers using Ganymede create **flows**, which are functions made up of user-editable **nodes**.  **Nodes** are used to ingest data, perform calculations, and interact with APIs.

- **Flow**: A sequence of nodes that processes data. The diagram above shows a flow named *ganymede_documentation*. Flows are executed from top to bottom, with edges indicating execution dependencies between nodes.
- [**Node**](./nodes/Overview.mdx): The fundamental processing unit in Ganymede, which handles input/output operations between different systems and user-defined components. The diagram above contains four nodes: CSV_Read, LIMS_Read, Associate_Data, and Excel_Write.

- [**Agent**](./connectivity/Agent.mdx): A locally-installed executable that captures data from external systems and makes it available to Ganymede flows. Agents are configured and monitored within the Connections section of the Ganymede UI, and can be customized using user-defined Python.
- **Agent Connection** / **Connection**: An instance of an Agent.  For example, you may customize a single Agent for uploading data from multiple flow cytometers, but each flow cytometer would have its own Connection.

- [**Tag**](./connectivity/Tags.mdx): A user-defined label applied to files to facilitate organization and searching. Each tag is linked to a specific tag type, which defines the label category. For example, a Ganymede environment might include an `Instrument` tag type, which an analytical chemistry team uses to label raw chromatograms with an `LC` tag. 

  Tag types are set up through the Manage Tag Types view on the Files page in the Ganymede UI. Once configured, these tag types can be referenced in user-defined code associated with Agents and Flows or specified in the Agent and Connection configuration pages within the Ganymede UI.

Each node consists of an Operator and, if customizable, user-defined SQL and/or user-defined Python to enable customization as shown in the conceptual diagram below:

</div>

Depending on the node, data may be retrieved from or sent to 
  - Relational/non-relational databases
  - cloud storage 
  - third-party API 
  - flat files

A comprehensive listing of different nodes and their attributes can be found on the [Node Overview page](./nodes/NodeOverview)

When flows are saved, whether from the flow editor or from a node specific to a notebook, associated code changes are stored in a git repository and deployed to a cloud-native workflow orchestration platform for executing code.
