Ganymede is a cloud-based data platform, engineered to streamline the capture and processing of data from lab instruments, ELN/LIMS/analytical applications, and third-party APIs.

**IT and Software Engineers** find Ganymede to be a unified, intuitive repository for coordinating their data processing needs by eliminating the need to set up bespoke cloud infrastructure for hosting and executing code.

**Process Engineers and Operations personnel** use Ganymede for observing process weaknesses and address bottlenecks.

**Scientists** leverage Ganymede to trace data generated from different sources, as it consolidates crucial data into one accessible location and processes it through shared pipelines to ensure reliability and accuracy in data capture and analysis.

**Executive Leaders** benefit from data-driven dashboards, facilitating transparent, informed planning and resource allocation decisions.

Some common use cases for Ganymede are:

**Asset Utilization / Reliability Analysis** - observing instrument usage and performance over time to identify trends and potential issues.

**Multilingual Connectivity** - providing a common platform that can ensure sample data, raw instrument output, and analyses travel together and are accessible in one place.

**Platform Data Processing** - ensuring that shared data processing is executed in a consistent and secure environment with visibility for process owners.

## A Quick Tour of Ganymede

The Ganymede Platform consists of a set of interchangeable components that enable data acquisition, processing, observation, and delivery.

Instrument data can be ingested into Ganymede in a variety of ways:

* [software installed on instrument PCs](connectivity/Overview#ganymede-agent), 
* [web-based file watcher requiring no local software installation](connectivity/Overview#browser-based-file-watcher), 
* [via events emitted by cloud platforms](connectivity/Overview#event-driven-processing), or 
* [by manual upload](connectivity/Overview#drag-and-drop).

Once captured, Ganymede offers an innovative [flow-based programming environment](FlowEditor) for processing data:

  </a>
</div>
&nbsp;

Ganymede allows users to choose and assemble nodes, each with unique default capabilities.  Customization is facilitated through [an intuitive interface](NodeEditor) that provides control over the logical processing performed by each node.

  </a>
</div>
&nbsp;

When a flow is executed, Ganymede [tracks details such as the user running the flow, input files, output files, and execution time](FlowRuns).  These are stored in a centralized location for streamlined tracking and accessiblility.

Data can be [tagged to ensure traceability](./connectivity/Tags) and [browsed](Files) ...

</div>

[structured data can be queried](DataExplorer)...

  </a>
</div>
&nbsp;

Raw or processed data can be delivered to ELN/LIMS systems, cloud storage, or lab instrument computers via [Flows](./nodes/App/APINode) or [Agents](./connectivity/Agent#watch-for-flow-outputs-then-save-locally).

More detail into how different components can be used together to address common integrations can be found in the [Reference Architectures](./ReferenceArchitectures) section.
