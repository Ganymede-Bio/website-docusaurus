**Software Engineers, IT, and Bioinformaticians** find Ganymede to be a unified, intuitive repository for all their coding needs.  It eliminates the need to set up bespoke cloud infrastructure for hosting and executing code.

**Executive Leaders** benefit from data-driven dashboards, facilitating transparent, informed planning and resource allocation decisions.

**Operations Teams** can identify organizational inefficiencies, enabling them to effectively streamline processes and address bottlenecks.

## Exploring Ganymede's Capabilities

At the heart of Ganymede lies an innovative [flow-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) environment, showcased below:

When a flow is executed, Ganymede meticulously captures details such as the user running the flow, input files, output files, and execution time.  These are stored in a centralized location for streamlined tracking and accessiblility.
